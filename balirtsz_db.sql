(1, 'Seminyak', 'seminyak', 'Seminyak is a mixed tourist / residential area on the west coast of Bali just north of Kuta and Legian. Originally a separate township, this is now just another suburb of Kuta. This area is very popular with resident expatriates and land and accommodation prices are amongst the highest in Bali. Plenty of luxury spas and hotels abound. Owing to its high density of high-end shopping, combined with the clustering of many fine eating establishments, it has rapidly become one of the most well-known tourist areas on the island.\r\n\r\nIn addition to a few commercial strips with popular and lively restaurants, bars, villas, and good crafts/furniture shops, there are a few notable establishments: Ku DÃ© Ta, which is a bar/restaurant with a cult following based on its beach side/semi-resort atmosphere that has earned it the title of number one party spot in various magazines, and Oberoi, which is an expensive hotel with a worldwide reputation. La Lucciola is a restaurant located in the north of Seminyak on the beach and has been in existence for over a decade.\r\n\r\nJalan Raya Seminyak (more often referred to as Jalan Legian), runs parallel with the beach, bisecting the district and acts as its main road artery.', '115.15671080', '-8.68986570', 1, '2016-06-08 12:06:06', '2016-08-31 07:12:49'),
(2, 'Canggu', 'canggu', 'The stunning greenery and beaches of Canggu are idyllic to an increasingly large public. Sometimes referred to as the fast developing new expat area, Canggu''s greenery can reach as far as its sandy beaches. Most surfers are no stranger to the town''s whopping waves. Swells are bigger and better for the more experienced wave-catcher and the surf crowd differs somewhat from the ones in Seminyak and Kuta. After being ''rediscovered'' as an area exuding serenity and peace, Canggu is undergoing a spurt of progression. In the next couple of years the town will be better equipped to pander to the more demanding visitor while, at the same time, it will likely lose some of its appeal by flocks of travellers escaping from hectic Seminyak and Kuta.', '115.12255340', '-8.63950750', 1, '2016-06-08 12:09:46', '2016-09-10 16:59:48'),

It is located 22 kilometers from Denpasar, the provincial capital of Bali, and administered under South Kuta District. Nusa Dua means two islands (nusa ''island'', dua ''two''), because there are 2 islands in the bay of Bali Tourism Development Corporation area. On the southern side lies Peninsula Island, and on the northern side lies Nusa Dharma Island, which is smaller but shadier, and which contains the Pura/Temple Nusa Dharma.', '115.17613150', '-8.79512230', 1, '2016-06-08 12:09:57', '2016-08-31 07:17:13'),

The town\\''s greatly sought after scenery of lime green rice paddies and cascading ravines, along with historic sites and century-old temples, is as popular as ever. Well-loved for its gorgeous bicycle routes, exciting trekking courses and white water rafting, Ubud is unlike any other Bali destination. Accommodation styles range from basic low budget to the most sumptuous in luxury. The township of painters is known to have been visited by movie legends, rock stars and international royalty.', '115.24852980', '-8.49613610', 1, '2016-08-25 13:38:17', '2016-09-10 16:58:43'),

Here also, there is a choice in standard. From local eateries to first rate restaurants, the overall experience is the same: savouring delectable fish and seafood while being humbled by dramatic sunsets and views over the Bali Strait. The sound of waves crashing on the sand and fishermen being witnessed hauling in their catch of the day leaves no one uninspired. Jimbaran is yet again a Balinese town wonderfully different from any other.', '115.12497830', '-8.78908150', 1, '2016-08-25 13:39:25', '2016-09-10 17:02:32'),

The inner sanctum of the shrine is majestically perched on the edge of a steep cliff that looks out over the outstanding surf breaks of southern Bali. Pura Luhur Uluwatu is regarded as one of the six most important temples in Bali, Pura Besakih being the principal one. Its location on the island''s south westernmost brim is believed to guard the Balinese people from evil spirits inhabiting the island''s surrounding waters.', '115.12497820', '-8.78873250', 1, '2016-08-25 13:40:56', '2016-09-10 17:03:20'),

Note Legian, Seminyak are actually subdivisions of Kuta), north to Jalan Arjuna (better known as Jalan Double Six) where Seminyak begins. Most of the popular Legian hotels are on or close to the beach. The whole of Legian is no bigger than a few blocks in a large city, but despite its small size, this area has a very high profile with visitors due to the lovely beach frontage, and proliferation of mid-market hotels.\r\n\r\nThe most popular stretch of Legian Beach is at the bottom of Jalan Padma, and is sometimes called Padma Beach. It is more relaxed than Kuta, has a better and less crowded surf break, and is home to many nice vendors selling beers under umbrellas. There is easy parking here for Rp 1,000 per motorbike.\r\n\r\nThere is a long north-south road between the beachfront hotels and the beach, which is only open for authorised vehicles when there is a ceremony being held. Otherwise it is a well paved footpath, and makes for an excellent walking route, allowing users an easy beach-side stroll along to restaurants, bars and nightclubs on Double Six Beach.\r\nMost of Legian can be covered on foot if you are not in a hurry, but taxis are plentiful as are motorbike rental outlets. Expect to pay Rp 50,000 to 80,000 per day for renting a motorbike.\r\n\r\nRental cars, with English-speaking driver, are available for Rp 500,000 per ten hour day. This includes petrol and parking fees.', '115.16303320', '-8.70436510', 1, '2016-09-18 23:01:04', '2016-09-18 23:06:40'),

A beautiful stroll garden has been created for our guests in our extensive grounds.&nbsp;</p><p>The&nbsp;romantic hideaway&nbsp;is&nbsp;classic&nbsp;of contemporary Balinese architecture with thatched roofs while open to the drama of their surrounding landscapes. Villa Vajra can comfortably accommodate 8 people. Each villa boasts its own private pool.</p>', '<p>Deep in the heart of Bali, perched on a venerated spur of land at the confluence of two rivers, is the stunning hideaway known as <strong>Villa Vajra</strong>. Designed by the internationally acclaimed architect, Guy Morgan, this modern, spacious villa sleeps up to seven guests and offers the ultimate in luxurious accommodation within a totally private and exclusive, close-to-nature setting.</p><p>The property and gardens are landscaped into the slopes of the steep valley, and the approach, via a raised wooden walkway through undisturbed rice fields, gives no clue to the remarkable design of the villa, or the breathtaking views of the jungle and river gorge.</p><p>Constructed with high quality local materials including ''alang alang'' thatch, Palimanan stone and teak wood; the property combines the very best of Balinese architectural elements with contemporary flair, elegant finishes and modern amenities. The villa presents a blend of outdoor living and air-conditioned comfort.</p><p>Villa Vajra is named after the quintessential symbol of Vajrayana Buddhism, a five-pronged ritual object often employed in conjunction with a bell. The Vajra is represented by a carving in a freestanding stone at the main entrance.</p><p>Every room and corner of the property has the effect of producing gasps of surprise and delight as guests view it for the first time. The villa is comprised of two buildings, linked on the upper level by a lotus pond and pergola. A serene Buddha statue stands within the lotus pond and white thunbergia cascades over the pergola-covered walkway leading to the Master Bedroom and Studio. The Master Bedroom is characterized by elegant furniture, teak floors, and glass on three sides to maximize the awesome views of the jungle and river valley. Sliding glass doors open on to a timber balcony, fringed by a food forest of fruit trees; the built-in bench seat is an ideal place to absorb the natural surroundings and listen to the ceaseless gurgle of the Ooz River as it coils its way through the deep gorge below. The en-suite garden bathroom is dominated by a large black terrazzo bathtub, creating a strong contrast against the white Palimanan stone floor. A black terrazzo wash stand supports a stylish chrome washbowl, and the shower is flanked by shelves and cabinets. Everything possible has been considered for the comfort of the guests; the luxurious open-air bathtub is sheltered by a thatched canopy, and privacy is maintained by a wall. Wooden shutters, like hatches within the wall, can be opened to reveal a view of the rice fields, and a larger hatch beside the bathtub offers the delightful alternative vista of the jungle. Tree ferns, birds'' nest ferns, and stepping stones across a star-grass lawn complete the natural decor of this charming garden bathroom.</p><p>Colourful local artwork adorns the walls of a passage way leading to the Studio on the same floor. Situated on the western side of the villa, this room boasts a panoramic view of the rice fields, and features a pitched roof, a cream terrazzo floor and more built-in cupboards and storage space. The Studio doubles as an additional bedroom and includes an en-suite toilet and shower room with a marble floor and black terrazzo washstand.</p><p>The adjacent building, across the lotus pond, holds the Study, with a flat screen satellite TV, DVD player and a quality sound system for the entertainment of the guests. This room also doubles as an additional bedroom with an en-suite shower room and a stone terrace that appears to almost float within the gently swaying fields of rice. Cushioned seating is built into the low wall encircling the terrace, thereby creating a comfortable place for relaxing with a book while enjoying a coffee or a cocktail at sunset. A cathedral window in the Study room overlooks the main living and dining area on the lower level, which is accessed by an external cantilevered staircase.</p><p>It is upon reaching this lower level that visitors will be able to fully appreciate the unique design of the villa. The gargantuan, 12 x 8 metre, living and dining pavilion extends the full height of the building and features a marble floor underneath a vaulted roof supported by coconut-wood pillars on stone plinths. Furnished with rattan chairs and sofas, pendulous steel globe lanterns and Buddhist welcome statues, this pavilion represents open living at its very best, and is a fantastic venue for parties, receptions and functions. A small aviary is situated to one side, and a large hatch links the dining area with the fully equipped kitchen, where the cook will prepare a range of delicious Indonesian and Western meals. Next door is a toilet and a shower, and the laundry and staff quarters are situated at the back. The adjoining semi-circular timber deck overhangs the lush river valley and provides an alternative romantic dining area. Living jackfruit trees grow through holes that have been cut in the floor of the deck, creating a solution that blends style with nature without threatening the environment. A further example of environmental conservation is the water recycling system that has been devised for the 8 x 3 metre infinity edge swimming pool, the outdoor Jacuzzi, and the graceful cascade flowing down from the lotus pond above. Another Buddha statue rests within an alcove behind the cascade.</p><p>The Guest Room is situated at pool level, within the building that houses the Master Bedroom and Studio. Furnished with a dreamy four-poster bed, the Guest Room features a Palimanan stone floor, windows with sliding doors facing the valley, a dressing room, and a garden bathroom with a black terrazzo tub, shower and toilet.<br />Rustic stone steps lead down from the swimming pool to the lowest level, past an outdoor shower, a bed of beautiful white peace lilies, and a small lotus pond contained within a stone pot. At this level there is an open terrace overlooking a grassy meadow within the valley. Another wooden deck juts out to one side and a narrow path leads down to the river past a small temple and a coconut grove. On one side is a secret sanctuary, a traditional open pavilion, known as a ''bale'', with a thatched roof and a raised teak floor scattered with cushions for relaxing. Even here, guests can enjoy music from the sound system, which boasts eight speakers directed towards every corner of the property. On the other side, a fully equipped gym provides the facility to maintain a daily fitness routine while appreciating the wonderful views.</p><p>The Master Bedroom, Guest Room, Studio and Study each feature individually controlled air-conditioning units and powerful ceiling fans to keep the rooms pleasantly cool. There are telephone lines for IDD calls and in-house calls in each room, and also safety deposit boxes. At night the villa takes on a different persona, with cleverly concealed lighting. Guests will appreciate the fresh cool air, and will be serenaded by a chorus of frog song to the accompaniment of ritual music from the village temples and the constant murmur of the river.</p><p>There is a barbeque terrace at the front of the villa beside the rice fields and parking space for up to six vehicles. Due to the steep hillside elevation, the villa is not recommended for disabled people or young children.</p><p>Villa Vajra is situated in the quiet traditional village of Sebali in the district of Kaliki, an hour and fifteen minutes'' drive from Ngurah Rai international airport, and about ten minutes'' drive from the cultural town of Ubud. This remarkable town is Bali''s centre for fine arts, dance and music, and the surrounding villages are home to Bali''s most accomplished painters, dancers, musicians and carvers. It is located 300 metres above sea level in the foothills of the central mountain range; this gives it a fresher, more pleasant climate than the southern coastal regions. The numerous art galleries in Ubud display traditional and modern work; the museums showcase the island''s rich history, and the shops and the market stalls sell handicrafts, jewellery, woodcarvings, textiles, paintings and antiques. There are many, well-presented, cultural performances staged in the town, in particular the Hindu epic, the Ramayana; also the Kecak Dance, the Fire Dance, the Monkey Dance and the Legong Dance. The countryside around Ubud is particularly beautiful, with an abundance of trails offering memorable walks through the peaceful rice fields.

(10, 1, 'Villa Windusari', 'villa-windusari', 1, 0, '<p>Seminyak is one of the most vibrant areas in Bali, which has numbers restaurants, boutiques and nightclubs. Several famous restaurants like Ku De Ta, Living Room and La Lucciola offers delicious dishes that tempt all the culinary lovers. The rapid development of tourism business in Seminyak, results in many villas were built to meet the needs of the tourists for safe and comfortable housing. One of the villas that meet international standard of luxury accommodation is Villa Windusari that is located in the center of Seminyak and just steps away from Petitenget Beach that blessed with stunning sunset view and surfersâ favorite spot.</p>', '<div class="intro"><p>Those seeking a chic centre-of-the-action yet peaceful location for their Bali vacation will find the fully staffed Villa Windu Sari has lots to offer.&nbsp; This spacious four-bedroom villa is securely set down a quiet cul-de-sac in a private community of villas in Petitenget, less than a kilometer from the beach, within walking distance of some of Baliâs best restaurants and bars, and a short taxi-ride from Seminyak.</p><p>The focus of this handsome tropical home is the 12.5-metre pool â framed by a pair of two-storey pavilions arranged in an L shape, with a third side taken up by the sun-deck and poolside bale. But the hub is the open-plan living room â a huge fan-cooled space leading directly to the pool terrace, where guests can settle into comfortable sofas or congregate around the enormous teakwood dining table that extends to seat 14. Behind (but out of sight) is the gleaming modern kitchen where the villa chef concocts mouthwatering meals and snacks throughout the day, served by the four butlers who between them provide attentive 24-hour service.</p><p>When the pull of socializing pales, there are lots of places to retreat to. How about a work-out in the well-equipped gym? Some down-time in the air-conditioned media room (where you can also check your emails on the computer)? Or an afternoon siesta on the bedroom balcony? The four bedrooms occupy a separate pavilion and open onto the balcony or directly onto the pool terrace).</p><p>Good news for larger groups: Villa Windu Sari can also be booked in conjunction with the six-bedroom Villa Windu Asri, together offering 10 bedrooms.</p><p>Letâs give the last word on Villa Windu Sari to a guest on departure: âTo spend quality time with oneâs family is priceless.

Access to the Property may be refused if security deposit is not paid in full. When the security deposit is required to be paid in cash, or when a non-standard security deposit applies, Management will inform the Guest in advance of the amount payable and any other conditions.</p><p>The security deposit will normally be refunded at the end of the rental period, after deducting:</p><ul>	<li>all additional expenses incurred on the Guestâs behalf (e.g. additional charges for goods, services and staff which have not been directly paid by the Guest, and telephone and internet charges, if applicable) and</li>	<li>the cost of replacement or repair for any loss or damage to the Property or its surrounds or contents caused during the Rental Period.

In return for this commitment, no refunds will be made for any exchange rate fluctuations that would otherwise reduce the rental cost.</p><p>Management reserves the right to impose any taxes or other charges which may be implemented by any government or other regulatory body, which were unknown at the time of publishing.

Management will do its best to accommodate any reasonable amendments, but the Guest should be aware that some changes may not be possible.</p><p>Please note that these amendment policies apply for regular booking periods. Special amendment terms may apply for peak/high seasons and will be stated in the Property description, booking confirmation or reservation voucher. If the information in any of these is inconsistent, the most recently issued terms will prevail.</p><p>In the unlikely event that Management is unable for any reason (including the sale of a property and force majeure) to provide the Guest with the Property booked by the Guest, Management reserves the right to transfer the Guest and their party to an alternative Property of the similar type and value, in consultation with the Guest. If the price of the substituted Property is less than the original booking, the difference will be reimbursed to the Guest. If the price of the substituted Property is higher than the original booking, the difference may be charged to the Guest. If, however, after considerable effort by Management, no alternative of similar type and value is available and / or no agreement can be reached between the Guest and Management, then either Management or the Guest may opt to cancel the booking and this Rental Contract. In that event, Management will refund the Guest all monies paid, without further compensation.</p><h4><strong>Complaints</strong></h4><p>Every attempt will be made for the Guest to have an enjoyable stay. If the Guest should have a problem during the Rental Period, please inform the Owner or Ownerâs Representative immediately who will endeavour to put things right.

The following deposit payment must be received by Management:</p><ul>	<li>For rentals beginning more than 60 days after the date of the booking request â a deposit of 50% of the total rental amount is payable</li>	<li>For rentals beginning 60 days or less after the date of the booking request â the total rental amount is payable as a deposit</li></ul><p>If the required deposit payment is not received within the 5 working day period, Management&nbsp;reserves the right to void the Guestâs booking request.</p><p>Where a 50% deposit applies to the booking, the Guest must pay the remaining 50% balance not less than 60 days before the scheduled arrival date.</p><p>All payments must be made in US Dollars, unless otherwise agreed with Management, and must be made in accordance with managementâs payment instructions as set out in the Guestâs booking confirmation.</p><p>If payments are not made on or before the due dates as required herein, the Owner or the Ownerâs Representative may cancel the booking, in which case this Rental Contract will be thereby terminated without any further notice required.

There are generally no additional costs, surcharges, taxes, staff salaries, or management fees above the price quoted unless otherwise stated in the property description, the Guest booking confirmation or reservation voucher. If the information in any of these is inconsistent, the most recently issued terms will prevail.</p><p>Typically telephone and internet charges and provisioning costs will be the Guestâs responsibility. Gratuities for household staff are encouraged and normal, but are left entirely to the Guestâs discretion.</p><h4><strong>Reservation Voucher</strong></h4><p>Confirmation details, the Property address, contact details of the Owner or Ownerâs Representative, transfer arrangements and directions to the Property will be sent to the Guest in a reservation voucher when full payment is received. This voucher, along with the Guestâs passport, need to be presented upon arrival.</p><p><strong>Security Deposit</strong></p><p>A security deposit may be payable directly to the Owner or Ownerâs Representative immediately upon arrival at the Property. The standard security deposit required for each Property is stated in the Property description; however the Owner has the right to impose different requirements on a case by case basis. Access to the Property may be refused if security deposit is not paid in full. When the security deposit is required to be paid in cash, or when a non-standard security deposit applies, Management will inform the Guest in advance of the amount payable and any other conditions.</p><p>The security deposit will normally be refunded at the end of the rental period, after deducting:</p><ul>	<li>all additional expenses incurred on the Guestâs behalf (e.g. additional charges for goods, services and staff which have not been directly paid by the Guest, and telephone and internet charges, if applicable) and</li>	<li>the cost of replacement or repair for any loss or damage to the Property or its surrounds or contents caused during the Rental Period. If this cost cannot be reasonably determined prior to the Guestâs departure, the Owner or the Ownerâs Representative is entitled to withhold a reasonable estimate from the Guestâs security deposit, and will return any balance to the Guest as soon as possible after the actual cost has been determined.</li></ul><p><strong>Damage or Losses</strong></p><p>A Property is typically someoneâs home. Please treat the Property rented accordingly, and leave the Property and all its contents in good order and in an acceptably clean condition.</p><p>Any damage or losses caused during the Rental Period, as well as any special cleaning requirements will be the Guestâs responsibility and may be charged to the Guestâs account and deducted from the Guestâs security deposit. In cases of excessive or unacceptable loss or damage at any time during the Rental Period, the Owner or Ownerâs Representative may require the Guest and their party, including visitors to vacate the Property immediately, without compensation or refund.</p><h4><strong>Access</strong></h4><p>The Property and its facilities are available for the Guestâs full enjoyment during the Rental Period. However the Owner, Ownerâs Representative, or other staff and contractors may need access to the Property from time to time (e.g. for maintenance purposes to the house, garden, swimming pool, utilities and services, or for the purposes of providing additional services requested by the Guest, etc.). The Guest is required to give them reasonable access to the Property for these purposes.</p><p><strong>Number of Guests</strong></p><p>The number of persons (adults and children) staying at the Property must not exceed the maximum number of sleeping places indicated in the booking confirmation and reservation voucher, unless specifically authorised in writing. Exceeding this number may invalidate any insurance policy on the Property. Entry or access to the Property may be refused or limited where the number of guests exceeds the stated requirement. No pets are allowed unless agreed in writing in advance.</p><p><strong>Use of Property</strong></p><p>All bookings are assumed to be for normal holiday purposes only, and the Guest agrees that the use of the Property will be limited to this purpose unless otherwise confirmed in writing.</p><p>If the Guest is planning to hold an event, such as a wedding or party, which involves having a larger number of people at the Property, or if the Guest is planning to use the Property for a purpose other than holiday, please communicate this to Management&nbsp;at the time of booking, as special approval or arrangements may be required. Depending on the nature of the event, a surcharge and/or additional security deposit may be required, which will be agreed and confirmed in writing prior to confirming the reservation. Note that some Properties are in residential areas or estates, and some are subject to rules and regulations regarding their use. Therefore, it may not always be possible to grant permission for certain uses or activities due to these or other reasons beyond the control of Management&nbsp;and the Owner.</p><p>If Management&nbsp;has confirmed a booking which includes an event at the Guestâs chosen Property, in certain circumstances the Guest must then obtain permits from the police and the local community before the event can proceed. The Guest acknowledges and agrees that Management, the Owner and the Ownerâs Representative cannot control the issue of these permits. If the police and/or the local community refuse to issue a permit for an event at the Property, the Owner or the Ownerâs Representative will refund any event fee paid by the Guest to the Owner, however neither Management, the Owner nor the Ownerâs Representative will be liable for any further refund or payment to the Guest.</p><h4><strong>Conduct and Due Care</strong></h4><p>Properties are generally located in quiet residential neighbourhoods. The Guest is asked to respect this, and ensure that all guests and visitors to the Property behave appropriately. Illegal or immoral activities including gambling, prostitution, prohibited drugs, possession or use of pyrotechnics or dangerous goods, and possession or use of firearms and other weapons are all strictly prohibited. Smoking is generally prohibited unless stated otherwise in the booking confirmation or reservation voucher.</p><p>The Guest is responsible for the behaviour of the guests staying at the Property, as well as visitors to the Property during the Rental Period. Should any guest(s) or visitor(s) not behave in a suitable manner, the Owner or Ownerâs Representative may, in their absolute discretion, require the Guest, their party and/or visitor(s) to leave the premises and/or vacate the Property immediately, without compensation or refund</p><p>In the interests of safety, due care should be taken at the Property at all times, especially with children. Suitable supervision should be given around pools, beaches and roads, and when using all Propertyâs facilities.</p><h4><strong>Valuables and Security</strong></h4><p>Any Guest valuables or property left or used at the Property are at the Guestâs own risk. Neither Management, the Owner nor the Ownerâs Representative accepts any responsibility for loss of or damage to Guest property. The Guest is responsible for the Property during the Rental Period, and must ensure that all windows and doors are locked securely when not on the premises. Any act or omission by the Guest, their party and/or visitors which may negate or prejudice the Propertyâs insurance policy and/or results in loss or damage is the Guestâs responsibility.</p><p><strong>Price Fluctuation</strong></p><p>Once the Guestâs booking is confirmed, the price of the Guestâs reservation is fully guaranteed, even if Management&nbsp;changes the price on its website after the Guestâs booking has been confirmed. In return for this commitment, no refunds will be made for any exchange rate fluctuations that would otherwise reduce the rental cost.</p><p>Management reserves the right to impose any taxes or other charges which may be implemented by any government or other regulatory body, which were unknown at the time of publishing. Management will tell the Guest promptly in the unlikely event that it becomes aware that any taxes or charges will apply to the Guestâs booking.</p><h4><strong>Cancellations</strong></h4><p>If the Guest wishes to cancel a confirmed booking, written notice of cancellation must be sent to Management. All cancellation notices received by Management will be acknowledged in writing. It is strongly recommended that the Guest and all members of the Guestâs party purchase trip cancellation insurance.</p><p>Cancellation of a booking includes but is not limited to:</p><ul>	<li>Cancellation of one or more days of a booking;</li>	<li>An amendment of a booking so that none of the dates of the booking once amended fall within the same dates that originally constituted the booking;</li>	<li>Failure of all Guests to provide the required documentation on arrival (eg. Passports or suitable identification); and</li>	<li>Attempt by the Guest, their party or visitors to hold an event at the Property in breach of these Terms and Conditions or breach of any rules applicable to the Guestâs chosen Property.</li></ul><p>In the event that the Guest cancels a confirmed booking, the following cancellation fees will generally apply:</p><ul>	<li>20% of the total rental amount will be forfeited if the cancellation is made more than 60 days before the start of the rental period</li>	<li>50% of the total rental amount will be forfeited if the cancellation is made between 30 and 60 days before the start of the rental period</li>	<li>100% of the total rental amount will be forfeited if the cancellation is made between 1 and 29 days before the start of the rental period.</li></ul><p>The applicable amount will be deducted from the deposit and moneys paid, and Management will refund any remaining balance to the Guest.</p><h4><strong>Amendments</strong></h4><p>Once a booking confirmation is issued by Management, a fee of USD 50 will apply to each amendment made. Management will do its best to accommodate any reasonable amendments, but the Guest should be aware that some changes may not be possible.</p><p>Please note that these amendment policies apply for regular booking periods. Special amendment terms may apply for peak/high seasons and will be stated in the Property description, booking confirmation or reservation voucher. If the information in any of these is inconsistent, the most recently issued terms will prevail.</p><p>In the unlikely event that Management is unable for any reason (including the sale of a property and force majeure) to provide the Guest with the Property booked by the Guest, Management reserves the right to transfer the Guest and their party to an alternative Property of the similar type and value, in consultation with the Guest. If the price of the substituted Property is less than the original booking, the difference will be reimbursed to the Guest. If the price of the substituted Property is higher than the original booking, the difference may be charged to the Guest. If, however, after considerable effort by Management, no alternative of similar type and value is available and / or no agreement can be reached between the Guest and Management, then either Management or the Guest may opt to cancel the booking and this Rental Contract. In that event, Management will refund the Guest all monies paid, without further compensation.</p><h4><strong>Complaints</strong></h4><p>Every attempt will be made for the Guest to have an enjoyable stay. If the Guest should have a problem during the Rental Period, please inform the Owner or Ownerâs Representative immediately who will endeavour to put things right. Should the Owner or Ownerâs Representative not address the Guestâs problem satisfactorily, please contact Management promptly. In order for the Guestâs complaint to be addressed, the Guest must communicate any problem whilst on location. If no complaint is reported during the Rental Period, Management and the Owner will assume that the Property was to the Guestâs satisfaction and no complaint will be entertained.</p><p><strong>Provisions</strong></p><p>Self-catering accommodations require that the Guest supply all provisions and consumables necessary for daily living. The staff at the Property may accommodate any reasonable requests to purchase provisions on the Guestâs behalf, and this will be charged to the Guestâs account.</p><p><strong>Managementâs Responsibility</strong></p><p>The descriptions, assessments and/or ratings of Properties and surrounding locations that Management publishes or gives to the Guest are provided in good faith and in the belief that they are accurate based on the latest information received. However, Management cannot be held responsible for any modifications to the Properties or inaccuracies. Where Management publishes or refers to descriptions, assessments and/or ratings of the Property either by Management or by third parties, these ratings are for information purposes only and Management will not be held responsible for any reliance placed on these ratings.</p><p><strong>Disclaimers</strong></p><p>Neither Management, the Owner nor the Ownerâs Representative accepts any responsibility or liability for:</p><ul>	<li>any physical injury, sickness, death, loss, damage, inconvenience or additional expenses incurred by the Guest, their party or visitors regardless of the cause;</li>	<li>any vehicle or the contents of any vehicle used, hired or engaged by the Guest or their party during the Rental Period;<br />	inability of the Guest or any member of the Guestâs party to enter the location of the Property or stay at the Property for all or part of the Rental Period as a result of failure to obtain appropriate travel or visa documentation, cancellation or amendments to travel arrangements or the missing of flights or travel connections; and/or</li>	<li>any delay or cancellation of the booking as a result of war, threat of war, riot or civil strife, strike, demonstration, terrorist activity (threatened or actual), natural disaster, fire, sickness, weather conditions, action at an airport or port by any government or public authority, technical problems relating to transport and airport regulations caused by technical, mechanical or electrical breakdowns, or any technical, structural, electrical, plumbing or other problems or difficulties with the Property which make it unsafe or unusable, or any other circumstances which amount to âforce majeureâ or Acts of God, or other events beyond the Ownerâs control.</li></ul><p>In no case will Management, the Owner or the Ownerâs Representative individually or collectively be liable to make any payment or give any refund or compensation of any amount over and above the total rental amount paid.</p><h4><strong>Jurisdiction&nbsp;</strong></h4><p>This agreement will be governed by the laws of Hong Kong. In the event of controversy arising from the booking and Property rental that cannot be resolved amicably between the parties, both parties agree to exclusively refer the matter to the Singapore International Arbitration Centre to be resolved finally by arbitration in the English language.</p><p>By making its booking request, the Guest agrees that these terms and conditions have been read, understood and have been accepted and agreed to by the Guest without reservation and without exception.</p><p>If any of the conditions of this Rental Contract are or become or are deemed to be invalid, or if there is any omission from any terms and conditions, the remaining terms and conditions will remain valid and enforceable and cannot be contested.</p><p><strong>Seasons</strong></p><ul>	<li>Low Season&nbsp;(Min.

All are accessed by antique Javanese doors and are fan-cooled as you will have no need for air-conditioning in these refreshingly cool highland climes. One bedroom on the middle-level is air-conditioned for&nbsp; heat sensitive guests.<br />The delightfully spacious, high-roofed master bedroom on the upper floor is furnished with a queen-sized bed crafted from old teakwood, as well as an antique Javanese batik table and a glass-fronted cabinet of books. The ensuite marble bathroom is accessed via a walk-through dressing room and is fitted with a luxurious terrazzo corner soaking tub for two. A door opens to a open-air shower deck, bordered by walls that are high enough for privacy yet low enough at the front to enjoy the view. One wall is decorated with a hand-carved frieze depicting Dewi Sri, the rice goddess, while carved panels in the front wall showcase lotus flower motifs and allow a glimpse of the rainforest . Glass doors at the front of the bedroom open onto the terrace where there is a cushioned daybed for relaxing. This is a serene spot for enjoying the glorious valley view.</p><p>The second bedroom on the upper floor is furnished with an antique Javanese queen-sized bed, while the third bedroom contains a pair of twin beds. A large marble bathroom with a deep terrazzo soaking tub, an outdoor shower and a double vanity is shared between these two bedrooms and accessible from both. The semi-circular marble shower deck is bounded by high walls for privacy, with a rainshower open to the sky. The queen room is fitted with glass doors that open to the terrace and the river gorge at the front.</p><p>The middle level presents two more bedrooms, positioned on either side of the main dining area. Both are furnished with queen beds and wardrobes. One bedroom has sliding glass doors that open to the terrace and an ensuite indoor bathroom with a terrazzo bathtub and handheld shower. The other bedroom has a window overlooking the view and an ensuite bathroom with a corner soaking tub, as well as a big open-air shower deck with bathing goddesses carved into a stone panel.</p><p><strong>Main Living Area</strong></p><p>A traditional gateway protected by stone guardians heralds the entrance to the villa. A garden path leads through tranquil lotus and water-lily filled fish ponds to an open porch furnished with two carved sofas. A pair of huge, antique Javanese doors opens onto the upper level and main living area, which is characterised by a soaring âalang-alangâ roof hung with pendulous fish-trap lanterns, and an open terrace at the front. The living space is furnished with Dutch colonial-style rattan chairs and a sofa, and equipped with a satellite-channel TV with a VCR and DVD player. In the corner is a desk and laptop computer for guest use with free WiFi internet access. Antique furnishings include a kartini sofa, and a gerobok chest originally used for storing rice. The terrace, which is sheltered by the eaves of the roof and bounded by a paras stone balustrade wall provides an breath-taking vista of the forest. This is accompanied by an abundance of fresh air, natural light, and the constant swirl of the Petanu River as it carves its way through the valley below.</p><p><strong>Dining Room</strong></p><p>From the upper floor, a staircase curves down to the middle floor, presenting a large dining area with an integrated terrace, open at the front to the view. In the centre of the room is a dining table, constructed from sections of an antique Javanese house. The table can comfortably seat up to 10 guests, and is lit by two glass hanging lanterns, while the back wall is furnished with a carved sideboard and embellished with softly-lit alcoves showcasing woodcarvings of Balinese goddesses. The room is equipped with a sound system incorporating a CD player and speakers.<br />The spectacular open-air terrace serves the two bedrooms on this level. Sheltered by a roof and furnished with a small circular table with two low chairs, Dutch-colonial-styled seating for four, and a cushioned daybed, it is a lovely area for relaxing.</p><p><strong>Kitchen</strong></p><p>A small kitchen is situated next to the dining area where the staff prepare breakfast. It is fitted with terrazzo worktops, a four-burner gas hob, modern appliances and utensils. There is a full-size fridge for guests to store their own food and drinks along with tea and coffee making facilities. The main kitchen is located in the separate staff service building.</p><p><strong>Swimming Pool &amp; Sun Deck</strong></p><p>On the lowest level, accessed by a stone stairway, is a freeform, infinity-edge swimming pool, which appears to overflow into the jungle below and offers stunning views of the tropical forest and the rush of the river. To one side of the pool is a terracotta tiled sundeck with four sunbeds.</p>', '<p>Our five villas are supported by a cherished âfamilyâ of 18&nbsp; friendly staff, who have a profound knowledge of the locale, and fulfil their duties with enthusiasm, smiles and genuine warmth.

There are generally no additional costs, surcharges, taxes, staff salaries, or management fees above the price quoted unless otherwise stated in the property description, the Guest booking confirmation or reservation voucher.

The standard security deposit required for each Property is stated in the Property description; however the Owner has the right to impose different requirements on a case by case basis. Access to the Property may be refused if security deposit is not paid in full. When the security deposit is required to be paid in cash, or when a non-standard security deposit applies, Management will inform the Guest in advance of the amount payable and any other conditions.</p><p>The security deposit will normally be refunded at the end of the rental period, after deducting:</p><ul>	<li>all additional expenses incurred on the Guestâs behalf (e.g. additional charges for goods, services and staff which have not been directly paid by the Guest, and telephone and internet charges, if applicable) and</li>	<li>the cost of replacement or repair for any loss or damage to the Property or its surrounds or contents caused during the Rental Period.

Please treat the Property rented accordingly, and leave the Property and all its contents in good order and in an acceptably clean condition.</p><p>Any damage or losses caused during the Rental Period, as well as any special cleaning requirements will be the Guestâs responsibility and may be charged to the Guestâs account and deducted from the Guestâs security deposit. In cases of excessive or unacceptable loss or damage at any time during the Rental Period, the Owner or Ownerâs Representative may require the Guest and their party, including visitors to vacate the Property immediately, without compensation or refund.</p><h4><strong>Access</strong></h4><p>The Property and its facilities are available for the Guestâs full enjoyment during the Rental Period. However the Owner, Ownerâs Representative, or other staff and contractors may need access to the Property from time to time (e.g. for maintenance purposes to the house, garden, swimming pool, utilities and services, or for the purposes of providing additional services requested by the Guest, etc.). The Guest is required to give them reasonable access to the Property for these purposes.</p><p><strong>Number of Guests</strong></p><p>The number of persons (adults and children) staying at the Property must not exceed the maximum number of sleeping places indicated in the booking confirmation and reservation voucher, unless specifically authorised in writing. Exceeding this number may invalidate any insurance policy on the Property. Entry or access to the Property may be refused or limited where the number of guests exceeds the stated requirement. No pets are allowed unless agreed in writing in advance.</p><p><strong>Use of Property</strong></p><p>All bookings are assumed to be for normal holiday purposes only, and the Guest agrees that the use of the Property will be limited to this purpose unless otherwise confirmed in writing.</p><p>If the Guest is planning to hold an event, such as a wedding or party, which involves having a larger number of people at the Property, or if the Guest is planning to use the Property for a purpose other than holiday, please communicate this to Management&nbsp;at the time of booking, as special approval or arrangements may be required. Depending on the nature of the event, a surcharge and/or additional security deposit may be required, which will be agreed and confirmed in writing prior to confirming the reservation. Note that some Properties are in residential areas or estates, and some are subject to rules and regulations regarding their use. Therefore, it may not always be possible to grant permission for certain uses or activities due to these or other reasons beyond the control of Management&nbsp;and the Owner.</p><p>If Management&nbsp;has confirmed a booking which includes an event at the Guestâs chosen Property, in certain circumstances the Guest must then obtain permits from the police and the local community before the event can proceed. The Guest acknowledges and agrees that Management, the Owner and the Ownerâs Representative cannot control the issue of these permits. If the police and/or the local community refuse to issue a permit for an event at the Property, the Owner or the Ownerâs Representative will refund any event fee paid by the Guest to the Owner, however neither Management, the Owner nor the Ownerâs Representative will be liable for any further refund or payment to the Guest.</p><h4><strong>Conduct and Due Care</strong></h4><p>Properties are generally located in quiet residential neighbourhoods. The Guest is asked to respect this, and ensure that all guests and visitors to the Property behave appropriately. Illegal or immoral activities including gambling, prostitution, prohibited drugs, possession or use of pyrotechnics or dangerous goods, and possession or use of firearms and other weapons are all strictly prohibited. Smoking is generally prohibited unless stated otherwise in the booking confirmation or reservation voucher.</p><p>The Guest is responsible for the behaviour of the guests staying at the Property, as well as visitors to the Property during the Rental Period. Should any guest(s) or visitor(s) not behave in a suitable manner, the Owner or Ownerâs Representative may, in their absolute discretion, require the Guest, their party and/or visitor(s) to leave the premises and/or vacate the Property immediately, without compensation or refund</p><p>In the interests of safety, due care should be taken at the Property at all times, especially with children. Suitable supervision should be given around pools, beaches and roads, and when using all Propertyâs facilities.</p><h4><strong>Valuables and Security</strong></h4><p>Any Guest valuables or property left or used at the Property are at the Guestâs own risk. Neither Management, the Owner nor the Ownerâs Representative accepts any responsibility for loss of or damage to Guest property. The Guest is responsible for the Property during the Rental Period, and must ensure that all windows and doors are locked securely when not on the premises. Any act or omission by the Guest, their party and/or visitors which may negate or prejudice the Propertyâs insurance policy and/or results in loss or damage is the Guestâs responsibility.</p><p><strong>Price Fluctuation</strong></p><p>Once the Guestâs booking is confirmed, the price of the Guestâs reservation is fully guaranteed, even if Management&nbsp;changes the price on its website after the Guestâs booking has been confirmed. In return for this commitment, no refunds will be made for any exchange rate fluctuations that would otherwise reduce the rental cost.</p><p>Management reserves the right to impose any taxes or other charges which may be implemented by any government or other regulatory body, which were unknown at the time of publishing. Management will tell the Guest promptly in the unlikely event that it becomes aware that any taxes or charges will apply to the Guestâs booking.</p><h4><strong>Cancellations</strong></h4><p>If the Guest wishes to cancel a confirmed booking, written notice of cancellation must be sent to Management. All cancellation notices received by Management will be acknowledged in writing. It is strongly recommended that the Guest and all members of the Guestâs party purchase trip cancellation insurance.</p><p>Cancellation of a booking includes but is not limited to:</p><ul>	<li>Cancellation of one or more days of a booking;</li>	<li>An amendment of a booking so that none of the dates of the booking once amended fall within the same dates that originally constituted the booking;</li>	<li>Failure of all Guests to provide the required documentation on arrival (eg. Passports or suitable identification); and</li>	<li>Attempt by the Guest, their party or visitors to hold an event at the Property in breach of these Terms and Conditions or breach of any rules applicable to the Guestâs chosen Property.</li></ul><p>In the event that the Guest cancels a confirmed booking, the following cancellation fees will generally apply:</p><ul>	<li>20% of the total rental amount will be forfeited if the cancellation is made more than 60 days before the start of the rental period</li>	<li>50% of the total rental amount will be forfeited if the cancellation is made between 30 and 60 days before the start of the rental period</li>	<li>100% of the total rental amount will be forfeited if the cancellation is made between 1 and 29 days before the start of the rental period.</li></ul><p>The applicable amount will be deducted from the deposit and moneys paid, and Management will refund any remaining balance to the Guest.</p><h4><strong>Amendments</strong></h4><p>Once a booking confirmation is issued by Management, a fee of USD 50 will apply to each amendment made. Management will do its best to accommodate any reasonable amendments, but the Guest should be aware that some changes may not be possible.</p><p>Please note that these amendment policies apply for regular booking periods. Special amendment terms may apply for peak/high seasons and will be stated in the Property description, booking confirmation or reservation voucher. If the information in any of these is inconsistent, the most recently issued terms will prevail.</p><p>In the unlikely event that Management is unable for any reason (including the sale of a property and force majeure) to provide the Guest with the Property booked by the Guest, Management reserves the right to transfer the Guest and their party to an alternative Property of the similar type and value, in consultation with the Guest. If the price of the substituted Property is less than the original booking, the difference will be reimbursed to the Guest. If the price of the substituted Property is higher than the original booking, the difference may be charged to the Guest. If, however, after considerable effort by Management, no alternative of similar type and value is available and / or no agreement can be reached between the Guest and Management, then either Management or the Guest may opt to cancel the booking and this Rental Contract. In that event, Management will refund the Guest all monies paid, without further compensation.</p><h4><strong>Complaints</strong></h4><p>Every attempt will be made for the Guest to have an enjoyable stay. If the Guest should have a problem during the Rental Period, please inform the Owner or Ownerâs Representative immediately who will endeavour to put things right. Should the Owner or Ownerâs Representative not address the Guestâs problem satisfactorily, please contact Management promptly. In order for the Guestâs complaint to be addressed, the Guest must communicate any problem whilst on location. If no complaint is reported during the Rental Period, Management and the Owner will assume that the Property was to the Guestâs satisfaction and no complaint will be entertained.</p><p><strong>Provisions</strong></p><p>Self-catering accommodations require that the Guest supply all provisions and consumables necessary for daily living. The staff at the Property may accommodate any reasonable requests to purchase provisions on the Guestâs behalf, and this will be charged to the Guestâs account.</p><p><strong>Managementâs Responsibility</strong></p><p>The descriptions, assessments and/or ratings of Properties and surrounding locations that Management publishes or gives to the Guest are provided in good faith and in the belief that they are accurate based on the latest information received. However, Management cannot be held responsible for any modifications to the Properties or inaccuracies. Where Management publishes or refers to descriptions, assessments and/or ratings of the Property either by Management or by third parties, these ratings are for information purposes only and Management will not be held responsible for any reliance placed on these ratings.</p><p><strong>Disclaimers</strong></p><p>Neither Management, the Owner nor the Ownerâs Representative accepts any responsibility or liability for:</p><ul>	<li>any physical injury, sickness, death, loss, damage, inconvenience or additional expenses incurred by the Guest, their party or visitors regardless of the cause;</li>	<li>any vehicle or the contents of any vehicle used, hired or engaged by the Guest or their party during the Rental Period;<br />	inability of the Guest or any member of the Guestâs party to enter the location of the Property or stay at the Property for all or part of the Rental Period as a result of failure to obtain appropriate travel or visa documentation, cancellation or amendments to travel arrangements or the missing of flights or travel connections; and/or</li>	<li>any delay or cancellation of the booking as a result of war, threat of war, riot or civil strife, strike, demonstration, terrorist activity (threatened or actual), natural disaster, fire, sickness, weather conditions, action at an airport or port by any government or public authority, technical problems relating to transport and airport regulations caused by technical, mechanical or electrical breakdowns, or any technical, structural, electrical, plumbing or other problems or difficulties with the Property which make it unsafe or unusable, or any other circumstances which amount to âforce majeureâ or Acts of God, or other events beyond the Ownerâs control.</li></ul><p>In no case will Management, the Owner or the Ownerâs Representative individually or collectively be liable to make any payment or give any refund or compensation of any amount over and above the total rental amount paid.</p><h4><strong>Jurisdiction&nbsp;</strong></h4><p>This agreement will be governed by the laws of Hong Kong.

Designed with colonial style and traditional Asian architecture, Villa Batavia built on 1.100 square meters area in the Seminyak area and just steps away towards Seminyak Beach. Shady trees, green grass and fishpond welcome you while you are stepping on the terracotta tiled. Beautiful yet refreshing ambience that providedgivesserenity and natural sense. And guests can praise some form of artworks such as colonial prints, old postcards, silver pots, and others that adorn the villa. Post-minimalism style by Villa Batavia is what ultimately invites guests to more freely enjoy their holiday in Bali.</p>', '<div class="intro"><p>Asiaâs grandest heritage hotels of the 1930s provide the strongest design influence for Villa Batavia, an enchanting five-bedroom villa (which can also be rented as a four), an easy stroll from Seminyak beach on Baliâs southwestern shore. Securely set in the Laksmana Estate among some of the islandâs most prestigious villas, Villa Batavia&nbsp; â the Dutch-era name for Jakarta&nbsp; â dazzles with its stunning colonial-style architecture. Expanses of chequerboard marble and granite floors, colonnaded verandahs, high ceilings and towering shuttered windows, brightly coloured oriental carpets on polished teakwood floors, plantation chairs and rattan furniture all evoke the romance of grand travelâ¦brought bang up to date with such high-tech treasures as Sonos sound system with Bose speakers, home theatre, high-speed WiFi, and HD TVs, DVD players and iPod docks in every room. And with deep shaded verandahs and air-conditioning even in the bathrooms, itâs a breeze to keep cool.</p><p>Increasing the sense of privilege, charming staff in crisp, gold-trimmed uniforms provide round-the-clock attention â serving an espresso and the morning paper perhaps, afternoon tea on the verandah with an heirloom silver tea set, or a Singapore Sling at sunset in the treetop-level bar. Two chefs are on hand to prepare gourmet dishes from a reasonably priced menu, elegantly served with fine bone china and silver-plated cutlery under an antique Javanese candelabra and complemented by fine wines and post-prandial brandy and cigars.</p><p>Villa Batavia delivers all the privileges of luxury living yet with the level of attention and privacy you simply canât experience even in a five-star hotel. With such pampering, there may be little reason to leave the confines of the villa. But itâs reassuring to know that youâre in the heart of chic Seminyak, and that a hop and skip away is a sublime choice of world-renowned bars, restaurants, boutiques and spas as well as Baliâs famed sunset beach.</p></div>', '<div class="faclitiesheading"><p><strong>Services:</strong></p><ul>	<li>Daily breakfast</li>	<li>Wifi internet connection<o:p></o:p></li>	<li>Welcome drink and fresh fruit basket upon arrival<o:p></o:p></li>	<li>Turn down setup service<o:p></o:p></li>	<li>Personal service by the villa staff including full time manager, housekeeper, chef, security<o:p></o:p></li>	<li>Exclusive use of the whole villa and listed facilities<o:p></o:p></li>	<li>Return airport transfer (1x in 1x out)</li></ul></div>', '<div style="margin-left:40px; clear:both"><p><strong>Facilities:</strong></p><div class="faclitiesheading">Capacity</div><div class="facdesc">10 people (5 bedrooms: 2 master rooms with king-size beds, 1 with twins and 2 guest rooms with queen-size beds); 2 extra roll-away beds (with additional charge).</div><div class="facdesc">&nbsp;</div><div class="faclitiesheading">Living areas</div><div class="facdesc">Reception room; bar and lounge; living and dining room; bedroom terraces; indoor dining for 10; garden <span style="font-style: italic;">balÃ©</span> with dining for 6.</div><div class="facdesc">&nbsp;</div><div class="faclitiesheading">Pool</div><div class="facdesc">16m x 6m with childrenâs paddling area.</div><div class="facdesc">&nbsp;</div><div class="faclitiesheading">Dining</div><div class="facdesc">An extensive individually priced menu of Indonesian, Asian and western cuisines; cocktails, spirits, wines, champagne and cigars; off-menu requests (including special diets) accommodated.</div><div class="facdesc">&nbsp;</div><div class="faclitiesheading">Communication</div><div class="facdesc">WiFi broadband internet access; telephone for charged local and IDD calls; printer and fax.</div><div class="facdesc">&nbsp;</div><div class="faclitiesheading">Entertainment</div><div class="facdesc">Satellite TVs (42-inch or 47-inch in the bedrooms); 52-inch TV home theatre in living room; DVD players; 5 iPod docks; Sonos music system with Bose speakers.</div><div class="facdesc">&nbsp;</div><div class="faclitiesheading">For families</div><div class="facdesc">Villa Batavia is well equipped for families.</div><div class="facdesc">&nbsp;</div><div class="faclitiesheading">Spa</div><div class="facdesc">On request, treatments selected from a comprehensive spa menu can be carried out by professional beauty therapists in the privacy of the villa (extra costs apply).</div><div class="facdesc">&nbsp;</div><div class="faclitiesheading">Additional facilities</div><div class="facdesc">Barbecue; in-room safes; full back-up generator; 6 yoga mats; 2 massage tables.</div><div class="facdesc">&nbsp;</div><div class="faclitiesheading">Events</div><div class="facdesc">Events for up to 20 seated guests, or 40 for cocktails, can be held at the villa with prior notice.</div><div class="facdesc">&nbsp;</div><div class="faclitiesheading">Property area</div><div class="facdesc">1,100sqm (land).</div></div>', '<div class="faclitiesheading"><strong>Staff:</strong></div><div class="facdesc">Villa staff team includes manager, chef, cook, butlers and gardener.

Access to the Property may be refused if security deposit is not paid in full. When the security deposit is required to be paid in cash, or when a non-standard security deposit applies, Management will inform the Guest in advance of the amount payable and any other conditions.</p><p>The security deposit will normally be refunded at the end of the rental period, after deducting:</p><ul>	<li>all additional expenses incurred on the Guestâs behalf (e.g. additional charges for goods, services and staff which have not been directly paid by the Guest, and telephone and internet charges, if applicable) and</li>	<li>the cost of replacement or repair for any loss or damage to the Property or its surrounds or contents caused during the Rental Period.

Exceeding this number may invalidate any insurance policy on the Property. Entry or access to the Property may be refused or limited where the number of guests exceeds the stated requirement. No pets are allowed unless agreed in writing in advance.</p><p><strong>Use of Property</strong></p><p>All bookings are assumed to be for normal holiday purposes only, and the Guest agrees that the use of the Property will be limited to this purpose unless otherwise confirmed in writing.</p><p>If the Guest is planning to hold an event, such as a wedding or party, which involves having a larger number of people at the Property, or if the Guest is planning to use the Property for a purpose other than holiday, please communicate this to Management&nbsp;at the time of booking, as special approval or arrangements may be required. Depending on the nature of the event, a surcharge and/or additional security deposit may be required, which will be agreed and confirmed in writing prior to confirming the reservation.

Special amendment terms may apply for peak/high seasons and will be stated in the Property description, booking confirmation or reservation voucher. If the information in any of these is inconsistent, the most recently issued terms will prevail.</p><p>In the unlikely event that Management is unable for any reason (including the sale of a property and force majeure) to provide the Guest with the Property booked by the Guest, Management reserves the right to transfer the Guest and their party to an alternative Property of the similar type and value, in consultation with the Guest. If the price of the substituted Property is less than the original booking, the difference will be reimbursed to the Guest. If the price of the substituted Property is higher than the original booking, the difference may be charged to the Guest.

In that event, Management will refund the Guest all monies paid, without further compensation.</p><h4><strong>Complaints</strong></h4><p>Every attempt will be made for the Guest to have an enjoyable stay. If the Guest should have a problem during the Rental Period, please inform the Owner or Ownerâs Representative immediately who will endeavour to put things right.

Special amendment terms may apply for peak/high seasons and will be stated in the Property description, booking confirmation or reservation voucher. If the information in any of these is inconsistent, the most recently issued terms will prevail.</p><p>In the unlikely event that Management is unable for any reason (including the sale of a property and force majeure) to provide the Guest with the Property booked by the Guest, Management reserves the right to transfer the Guest and their party to an alternative Property of the similar type and value, in consultation with the Guest. If the price of the substituted Property is less than the original booking, the difference will be reimbursed to the Guest. If the price of the substituted Property is higher than the original booking, the difference may be charged to the Guest.

This contract is effective on written confirmation by The Villa Management of the receipt of the necessary deposit payment by The Hirer, for the specified rental period as confirmed by The Villa Management.</p><p><strong>Cancellation / No show / No contact</strong></p><p>Payments are non refundable but can be transferred across to another booking within 12 months of the original intended arrival date.&nbsp; This is on the condition that cancellations are made no less than 3 months prior to the arrival date and will incur a 15% penalty fee. â¨Changing a booking is subject to availability.</p><p>In the event that only a deposit is received (compared with full rental payment) and it is less than 14 days prior to your arrival and you are not contactable we reserve the right to cancel your booking with no deposit refund. &nbsp;By being non contactable this includes, but is not limited to, the villa management not having heard from you despite us sending you a minimum of 5 emails with no contact from the Hirer in response. &nbsp;We will send you warning emails regarding this possibility if we need to exercise this option. &nbsp;If you want to avoid this occurring then please contact us regarding settlement of your accommodation prior to your arrival. &nbsp;We have a secured SSL website dashboard to enter in credit card details and can process balance payments via this method. &nbsp;We cannot accept balance payments into an Australian Bank Account.</p><p>As your package has been locked away across all your dates, the Hirer is required to pay the balance on the date of arrival. &nbsp;If the Hirer cannot pay the balance on date of arrival then this needs to be discussed and a resolution must be arrived at at least 14 days prior to the check in date. &nbsp;Resolutions are at the discretion of The Villa Management. &nbsp;If the Hirer, or any party of the hirer, does not stay for the entire rental term, then the balance payment (and package) is strictly not amendable. &nbsp;We expect that all guests have taken out the appropriate travel insurance so they can be reimbursed if there are any trip interruptions (such as flight changes, cannot travel due to health reasons, cannot travel due to personal commitments). &nbsp;We cannot stress enough the importance of taking out appropriate travel insurance.</p><p><strong>Late show</strong></p><p>As part of our customer service focus, we will always endeavour, at The Villa Managementâs discretion, to accommodate minor shifts to your plans.&nbsp; If possible, we will try and shift your reservation dates by a day or two, so you donât lose from your holiday time. However, please note that due to the popularity of our villas this may not always be possible, and this flexibility is provided as a goodwill gesture purely at the discretion of The Villa Management.</p><p><strong>Free car and driver service</strong></p><p>If your package includes the free car and driver service, then this service means that you have up to 8 consecutive hours each day that you stay. &nbsp;This service is not available on your day of checkout. &nbsp;There are strictly NO rainchecks for this service. &nbsp;This means, should you choose to not use the car/driver on one particular day, this does not mean that you have a spare 8 hours. If you would like more than 8 hours then there is a charge of IDR 100,000 per hour. &nbsp;Of this, your driver will receive 50,000 rupiah and the other 50,000 will go towards the use of the car and petrol. &nbsp;Although we will endeavour to keep the same driver throughout your stay, there may be times that we need to change your driver. &nbsp;When you are not using your car, the car may be used for other purposes, such as airport pickups/drop offs so please do not leave any of your belongings in the car as we cannot be responsible, should anything&nbsp;go missing. &nbsp;We have available 7 or 8 seater cars â depending on what size villa you book. &nbsp;Some packages include different arrangements, please see your booking confirmation email for the details of your booking.</p><p><strong>Complimentary Airport transfers</strong></p><p>Complimentary Airport transfer to and from airport is for one vehicle per booking unless specified otherwise. Additional vehicles required due to other flight arrival and departures, and group size or luggage will be charged at prevailing rates.&nbsp; If your flight arrives before 8.30am or after midnight then additional charges may apply (minimum IDR 250,000 per vehicle required).</p><p>Hotel or other accommodation transfers are available up to 1 hour prior to check-in. &nbsp;A hotel&nbsp;transfer is available in lieu of the airport transfer as long as the hotelâs location lies between the&nbsp;villa to the airport. &nbsp;For instance, Seminyak, Legian and Kuta â free transfers available (specific times may apply). &nbsp;Areas such as Nusa Dua, Sanur, Candidasa will incur an additional fee. &nbsp;If your transfer attracts an additional fee you will be notified, via email prior to your arrival, to ensure that you are aware of any charges. &nbsp;We will always, wherever possible, give you a free transfer option: this will involve waiting until your villa allocated car is available to pick you up so we do not have to hire a 2nd car/driver service.</p><p><strong>Meeting local laws and regulations</strong></p><p>It is a requirement of the Indonesian government, that all foreign guests arriving in hotels and villas are formally registered.&nbsp; At Villa Echo Beach, our staff will be more than happy to remove this burden from you by completing the registration process on your behalf.&nbsp; To this end, please ensure that all guests in your party arrive at the villa with their passports that they have used to enter Indonesia.&nbsp;

However, in some instances, (especially when dealing with small independent vendors), a formal receipt may not always be available.&nbsp; If you are adamant that each and every purchase made on your behalf is matched with a corresponding receipt, please instruct our staff on arrival to shop only at those vendors/suppliers who can provide receipts. &nbsp;&nbsp;If our staff are using their own motorbike to assist with anything you require you will be asked to pay a small amount to cover the use of their own transport.&nbsp; This may range anywhere from IDR 20,000 upwards.&nbsp; The most common fee is IDR 20,000.</p><p><strong>Limitations of services</strong></p><p>Whilst Indonesians, and specifically Balinese are incredibly welcoming and naturally very helpful people, please refrain from making any requests from The Villa Staff which may be deemed to be against the local customs, laws and regulations.&nbsp; Similarly, if you have any specific medical, nutritional or personal care conditions/requirements, please make these known to us at the Reservation Enquiry stage, and we will confirm if we are able to cater for these or not, and avoid any disappointment.</p><p><strong>Limitation of shopping services</strong></p><p>Villa Echo Beach staff will do their utmost to look after your every reasonable request during your stay, and are very happy to run errands and your driver more than happy to assist with shopping trips.&nbsp;

However, our staff will be more than happy to point you in the right direction, in terms of best suppliers, or shopping services to use for your larger or higher cost purchase requirements. â¨â¨Similarly, if you have some very specific shopping requirements (such as a certain type of medicine, or very specific nutritional requirements), please ensure that you purchase these items, as our staff are not liable for any damage/loss caused by any third party groceries/items purchased on your behalf.</p><p><strong>Insurance</strong></p><p>We strongly recommend that as with any other international travel, you take out full and comprehensive travel insurance for everyone traveling in your party, before your journey to Bali, that covers you for any reason cancellation with no excess. &nbsp;Ensure that your travel insurance covers you for your travel needs and any unforeseeable circumstances. &nbsp;We do not make exceptions to our non refundable deposit. &nbsp;We do not make exceptions to our 3 month cancellation policy. &nbsp;So please factor this in when choosing what type of insurance.</p><p>Please note that The Villa Management, BHP and Staff are not responsible for any damages/loss caused to persons or property of The Hirer and their Party during their stay at The Villa, including (but not limited to) illness, injury, death, loss of valuables, etc) caused by incidents, including (but not limited to) cancellations, acts of nature, floods, fire, acts of third parties, civil disturbances, failure of machinery/equipments, acts of government, acts of God etc. â¨Nor will The Villa Management, Staff, or/its Agents/Vendors be held responsible for any damages/loss caused by Hirer or their Party, including (but not limited to) any individual, estate, the local community, the island and people of Bali, the Indonesian government, the people and/or estate of the Republic of Indonesia.&nbsp;

Villa Ombak Laut boasts 100 metres of absolute beach frontage on Baliâs rugged south-west coast, and the roar of the ocean can be heard throughout the villa as waves crash against the black volcanic rocks and the spectacular sea temple that rises above them.</p><p>Carefully designed to capture the sea breeze and the ocean views, Villa Ombak Laut features individual living and sleeping pavilions with high-vaulted ceilings and&nbsp;<em>alang-alang</em>&nbsp;thatched roofs, fashioned on the traditional Balinese compound. An antique Javanese<em>gladak</em>&nbsp;(wooden house) forms the sixth bedroom adding to the Indonesian flair and charm that makes this villa so unique.</p><p>While the villa is undeniably luxurious, it is also very comfortable and welcoming. Built originally as the ownerâs family holiday home, Ombak Laut caters for all age groups. If the novelty of relaxing by the two delightful swimming pools wears off, guests have access to a private tennis court, a games room with billiard table, table tennis and bicycles for exploring the surrounding rice fields and villages.</p><p>But what really sets this villa apart are its impressive grounds that sprawl across one hectare. Coconut palms sway in the breeze, fragrant frangipanis give off their sweet scent and manicured lawns roll all the way to the ocean. From the perfectly positioned sunset<em>balÃ©</em>&nbsp;guests can see and breathe in the wild beauty of this dramatic coastline, and admire the mystical sea temple of Pura Gede Luhur Batungaus that lies just off shore.</p>', '<p><strong>Services</strong></p><ul>	<li>Complimentary airport transfers on arrival and departure.</li>	<li>Welcome drinks and refereshment towel once upon arrival.</li>	<li>Daily serving Breakfast.</li>	<li>Complimentary using a car &amp; a&nbsp;driver on standby for up to 8 hours per day (excludes petrol).</li>	<li>Security 24 hours.</li>	<li>Professional therapists in the privacy of the villa (extra costs apply).</li>	<li>Chef could prepare on request Western, Asian, vegetarian and childrenâs menu&nbsp;(including special diets).</li>	<li>Masseuse and Babysitter on request (surcharge).</li></ul>', '<p><strong>Facilities</strong></p><ul>	<li>Pool:&nbsp;18m infinity pool and free-form pool at&nbsp;joglo.</li>	<li>Living Areas:&nbsp;Open-sided living pavilion; dining room; games room; poolside dining for 10; sunset&nbsp;balÃ©.</li>	<li>Communication:&nbsp;WiFi internet access; landline for local calls; mobile phone coverage; fax and computer in managerâs office.</li>	<li>Entertainment:&nbsp;Satellite TV and DVD players; Bose surround-sound system with CD player; iPod adapter.</li>	<li>For families:&nbsp;&nbsp;a high chair; baby cot; DVDs; games; toys; 2 bicycle helmets.</li>	<li>Transport:&nbsp;Seven-seater car with driver on standby for up to 8 hours per day (excludes petrol).</li>	<li>Additional facilities:&nbsp;Safes; barbecue; backup generator; tennis court; billiard table; table tennis; 5 bicycles.</li>	<li>Property area:&nbsp;10,000sqm (land). 4335 sqm (villa).</li></ul><dl></dl>', '<p>The villa has a team, they are&nbsp;a villa manager; an assistant manager; chef, driver; 4 villa attendants; 4 gardeners; pool attendant; 6 security guards.

(40, 1, 'Khayangan Estate', 'khayangan-estate', 6, 0, '<p>The name comes from the old word for âSeventh Heavenâ. This private Bali villa estate is truly heavenly. In fact,&nbsp;<b>we believe it is the very best Bali luxury villa</b>. It rests on the south west tip of Bali in lovely gardens on a high cliff top, above a white sand beach. The villa offers one of the best views in Bali, with a grand vista of the ocean. It is hard to find another luxury Bali villa&nbsp;with such a good view.&nbsp;</p><p>The villaâs charm lies in its design. It is made up of two clusters of traditional, antique, wooden houses from Java. These were once the homes of noble men. They have been carefully grouped to echo the mood of an old village. The villas are set in a huge garden, with dense beds of yellow flowers, gently swaying palms, shrubs and trees. The villa is quite different from any other luxury Bali villa&nbsp;or luxury Bali resort.</p>', '<p><strong>Khayangan Estate</strong> is located in a beautiful area known as The Bukit - a limestone plateau rising sharply from the sea, fringed by steep cliffs and some of the most idyllic beaches in Bali. Characterised by wide open spaces and clear blue skies, the turquoise waters are the playground of migrating whales. A tropical, equatorial climate means year-round balmy temperatures and, even in the rainy season, The Bukit - which is much drier than the rest of the island - is a reliable sun-trap. When the southeast trade winds blow offshore and the southern ocean swells hit the reefs, the barrelling surf breaks are among the best in the world. The only other activity is seaweed farming, still traditionally practiced by the original Balinese coastal families.&nbsp;</p><p>With Bulgari Resort Bali as its prestigious neighbour, Khayangan Estate is only 30 minutes'' drive from Bali''s International Airport and no more than 45 minutes'' from the endless shopping, vibrant nightlife and international restaurants of Kuta and Seminyak. The world-class Bali Golf and Country Club in Nusa Dua is a mere 15 minutes'' drive, and Ubud - Bali''s centre for fine arts and cultural performances - is about 90 minutes'' drive to the north. The remainder of the island offers a rich mosaic of cultures, tastes, sights and sounds, together with a wide array of activities.</p><p>This is a place of mesmerising beauty with cliffs over 170 metres high, rolling surf, pristine white sand beaches, and magnificent 180-degree views of the Indian Ocean.</p><p>The original charm of these one hundred year old buildings has been kept. These Bali luxury villas are made of old teak wood. Here, you will find rich furnishings, as well as state of the art facilities. Bathrooms are the coolest on the island, especially those of the two master bedrooms. Each has a private water garden, where a dreamy bath tub appears to float in a clear pond.&nbsp;</p><p>The design of this luxury Bali villa estate presents guests with the choice of a three bedroom or a six bedroom renting option. There are two big lap pools, two smaller pools, and a cold plunge pool. There is also a business centre, a cliff edge bale,&nbsp;a gym, and a spa.&nbsp;</p><p>All of this not only makes for a great Bali holiday villa, but is also the best choice for a Wedding Villa.</p>', '<p><strong>Services</strong>&nbsp;</p><ul>	<li>Complimentary airport tranfers: pick up &amp; drop off.</li>	<li>Welcome drinks and refreshment towel once upon arrival.</li>	<li>Daily serving Breakfast.</li>	<li>A full complement of English-speaking staff, highly trained in the business of Bali luxury villas.</li>	<li>Personal butlers, on call 24 hours, are ready to help you make arrangements for a range of services.&nbsp;</li>	<li>24h security for a whole Estate.</li></ul><p><strong>Services for Wedding</strong></p><ul>	<li>Khayanganâs tropical wedding caterers will delight with their stylish, artistic expression.&nbsp;The wedding banquet may be a sumptuous four-course dinner.</li>	<li>For wedding events, professional hair and make up services will be made available for bride and&nbsp;attendants.</li>	<li>Specialised bridal boutiques present exquisite gift items and a wide selection of wedding dresses and men''s attire in a range of sizes, for the bride, groom, family and guests.&nbsp;Styles include designer labels, and gifts include sophisticated souvenir items.</li></ul>', '<p>&nbsp;<strong>Facilities</strong></p><ul>	<li>Living areas: Six&nbsp;ultra-lavish bedroom suites with the most romantic en-suite bathrooms;&nbsp;Two grand&nbsp;living and dining pavilions; A fully equipped modern kitchen;&nbsp;A fully equipped private office;&nbsp;A fully equipped gymnasium</li>	<li>Support facilities:&nbsp;Cliff edge Bale; Business Centre; A professionally equipped SPA;&nbsp;A cliff-top relaxation pavilion;&nbsp;</li>	<li>Pools: Two big lap pools;&nbsp;two smaller pools;&nbsp;and a cold plunge pool.</li>	<li>Entertainments: Individual sound system with iPod connections in every suite;&nbsp;A library of books;&nbsp;DVDâs and board games;&nbsp;Outdoor games including badminton, boules and lawn croquet</li>	<li>Communications:&nbsp;WiFi internet access throughout the estate.</li></ul><p><strong>Facilities Detail Descriptions</strong></p><p><strong>Khayangan Estate - Accommodation</strong></p><p><strong>Living &amp; Dining Pavilion</strong></p><p>Serenaded by the tranquil sound of water, guests will traverse an ornamental pond before entering the living and dining pavilion. This is the largest of the time-honoured teakwood Joglos, created over 100 years ago in Central Java in an area where skilled artisans have developed the art of carving wood to the highest degree of refinement. The Joglo''s most striking feature is its towering core of four intricately and exquisitely carved pillars, showcasing traditional patterns and flowers. Destined to be demolished, this wonderful old building was saved and carefully transplanted to Bali to create the heart and social hub of Khayangan Estate.</p><p>This expansive, air-conditioned living and dining area embraces the spectacular view with the incorporation of glass walls on two sides. It has been furnished with large sofas and chairs, a coffee table, a dresser and a rustic dining table for twelve, all custom-made from antique wood. White drapes fall between the central pillars, recycled floorboards are scattered with rugs, and the muted colour theme follows the natural hue of the timber. Antique statues and carvings from the islands of East Nusa Tenggara have been fondly placed in well-lit settings that show them off to their best advantage. Funky wrought iron lamps and lanterns, designed by the owners, channel a soft light by night, creating a romantic ambience. A large, flat screen, satellite TV, DVD and quality sound system is provided for guests'' entertainment. To the rear is a separate, fully-fitted, modern kitchen.&nbsp;</p><p>The master bedroom and guest rooms are housed within three, separate, self-contained Joglos, complete with en-suite bathrooms, wide verandahs, and lovely views of the ocean, the garden, the pool, and the social centre of the Estate. The authentic-style is elegant and enchanting. Each Joglo is air-conditioned and furnished with fitted wardrobes, seating, mirrors and lamps. Each boasts a king-size four-poster bed, built into the beams within the central funnel of the roof. Soft muslin drapes are clutched within simple tiebacks. Paintings, local textiles and ikat cushions create a personal touch. Each bedroom is equipped with a mini bar/fridge, safe, satellite TV, stereo system and telephone as well as wi-fi internet access.</p><p>Each luxurious en-suite bathroom is characterised by unique features. Each is equipped with air-conditioning, an all-embracing rainshower, a splendidly appointed bathtub, a toilet, single or twin washbasins, large mirrors, and the thoughtful provision of cushioned bench seats.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Master Bedroom &amp; Bathroom</strong></p><p>The master bedroom is particularly spacious, and enhanced with the added feature of a bay window and curved window seat, a wall of fitted wardrobes, a desk, an armchair, and a 39-inch flat screen plasma TV with satellite TV.&nbsp;</p><p>The sumptuous, air-conditioned en-suite bathroom is a study in symmetry, equipped with large mirrors and ''his and hers'' washbasins resting upon separate wooden vanity units within two distinct areas. A toilet, together with a bidet, is discretely positioned at one end, while a walk-in rainshower with a pebbled splashback is situated at the other end. The piece de resistance, however, can be found on the far side of an external glass door. Here, in a beautiful private water-garden, and accessed by stepping stones, a dreamy oversized bathtub, complete with an overhead canopy, appears to be floating in a gin clear ornamental pond. In the far corner of the pond is a ''floating'', open-sided relaxation pavilion, sheltered by a roof and furnished with a built-in sofa and cushions. The serene picture is completed with an ancient frangipani tree, staghorn and bird''s nest ferns, and a cascading waterfall.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Business Centre</strong></p><p>The air-conditioned business centre is a rare, two-storey timber Javanese house that has been transformed into a private office or work space, with a small, open-air meeting area upstairs. This enchanting building represents a bygone era with its raised, wrap-around verandah, and two-tiered roof. It features large glass windows, and has been lovingly furnished with an antique desk, chair, bookshelves, cupboards and a kilim rug. It is well-equipped with a computer, a multi-function printer, scanner and photocopier, and free Broadband Wifi Internet, which can be accessed all over the Estate. An external staircase leads up to the breezy meeting or relaxation area, furnished with a marble-topped table and chairs. Guests'' needs are further considered with the provision of a washroom.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cliff top Pavilion</strong></p><p>A large open-sided relaxation gazebo, fitted with cushioned seating, rests on the clifftop beside a freshwater Jacuzzi with a chiller. The pool is flanked by a timber deck furnished with canopied chairs.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Seventh Heaven Spa</strong></p><p>The architecture of the clifftop spa blends rusticity and glamour. Landscaped into the cliff, with a flat roof supporting a grassy lawn, it is built directly into the rock. The fully-equipped, air-conditioned spa with its glass-fronted curved facade, presents a Vichy shower, hot tub, steam room, massage tables, manicure and pedicure facilities, and a cave-like room for scrubs and water treatments. Overlooking the ocean and the beach, it is also a great spot for meditation. The spa menu offers a full range of massage, beauty treatments and therapies, such as the Ocean Bath, Flower Bath and Aromatherapy Bath, as well as a Cucumber Wrap for sunburnt skin.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gardens and Pool</strong></p><p>The gorgeous landscaped gardens of Khayangan Estate present a very natural feel. Pathways are paved with timber and bordered by dense beds of tall, gently swaying yellow irises. Immaculate lawns are punctuated with palms and other carefully selected native plants and trees, such as bougainvillea, frangipanis and climbers, to provide a balance of fragrance, colour and shade.&nbsp;</p><p>The infinity-edge, swimming pool is located in front of the main living and dining area. Shaded by coconut palms and frangipani, and lined with natural stone, the pool appears to flow over the edge of the cliff. The timber pool deck is furnished with canopied sunbeds, while a barbeque and pizza oven is positioned nearby, making alfresco dining easy and fun.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Sports Facilities</strong></p><p>The tennis court and a fully-equipped gym are located near the entrance to the Estate.&nbsp;</p><p>The tennis court has a covered spectator/viewing pavilion with benches and antique "gerobok" (rice storage trunks on wheels) with cushions.</p><p>The gymnasium is fully air-conditioned, and includes a full selection of machines, as well as a stereo system, satellite TV, fridge and cold water dispenser.</p><p><strong>Eco Friendly</strong></p><p><strong>Khayangan Estate</strong>&nbsp;incorporates many features designed to reduce its impact on the environment. Bio-degradable waste from the house and garden is collected, mulched and composted for use in the gardens. The garden is irrigated using an underground system that meters water usage on automatic timers. There is also a water purification plant, which produces drinking quality water in all taps. Solar panels have been installed on the roofs for heating water, and ionisers are used instead of chlorine in the swimming pool, which effectively turn the water into pure mineral water using a process approved by NASA. Low-wattage, long life, lighting fixtures keep energy costs down and timers and sensors are also used to avoid excess consumption of power. A waste water recycling system is planned.</p><p><strong>Khayangan Estate - Weddings and Parties</strong></p><p>Khayangan Estate presents the perfect setting for weddings, parties and other special events. The extensive lawns are also ideal for open-air Balinese dance performances and parties. The catering can be managed by professional caterers who have the world-class expertise to prepare a sumptuous feast in addition to the coordination of decorations, flowers, lighting and entertainment.</p>', '<ul>	<li>Estate manager</li>	<li>Executive chef</li>	<li>Professional spa therapists</li>	<li>Highly trained personal butlers</li>	<li>Kitchen staff</li>	<li>Housekeeping</li>	<li>Gardening staff</li>	<li>Engineering staff</li>	<li>Security staff</li></ul>', '<h3><strong>Terms &amp; Conditions</strong></h3><ul>	<li>All rates are&nbsp;quoted in US dollars per night.

In return for this commitment, no refunds will be made for any exchange rate fluctuations that would otherwise reduce the rental cost.</p><p>Management reserves the right to impose any taxes or other charges which may be implemented by any government or other regulatory body, which were unknown at the time of publishing.

Dappled by the light of both sunrise and sunset, the six-bedroom Longhouse overlooks a verdant jungle oftropical vegetation, dotted with village homes, all the way down to the bays of Benoa and Jimbaran. The villa''s decor features elements from across the Indonesia archipelago and an extensive staff provides top service in a luxury environment.</p>', '<p>As peaceful as it is, The Longhouse may feel very far away from the madding crowd and crazy tourist hustle that can characterise a trip to the likes of Kuta and Seminyak. Should you wish to immerse yourself in the various wonders of Bali, however, you will find that nothing is too far away. Especially given the access to driver and car that The Longhouse guests are treated to.</p><p>The best place to take advantage of the remarkable vistas is on the top floor with its outdoor lounge area, infinity swimming pool and a dining room clad in wraparound windows. Should you tire of the views from there, bales (Balinese gazebos) and daybeds abound on all three levels of the property while all six enormous, fully air-conditioned, en-suite bedrooms also offer views worth contemplating before sliding into blue sky dreams.</p><p>Built over three levels and decorated using a combination of modern and traditional, sleek steel and antique teak, cool stone and warm wood, state of the art technology and plush soft furnishings, The Longhouse comes complete with a gym and spa room, a fully-equipped and staffed kitchen, its own wine cellar and a villa manager to ensure your every need is met. There is also a rather convenient, beautiful wood-panelled in-house elevator and a fully equipped minihome theatre/media room, with couches begging to be sunk into and the biggest TV screen ever seen outside of a movie theatre.</p><p>The architecture of the property is striking and the villa contains a collection of art, crafts and artifacts lovingly collected by the owners; while in the open living area, with its traditional alang-alang (thatched) roof, a series of murals tell part of the famous Ramayana story. Each of the six spacious bedroom suites is themed after a different Indonesian island and contains art, crafts and motifs from that island.

Sliding glass doors bring the balmy Bali outdoors indoors throughout, but for some respite from the tropical heat, all the bedrooms are fully air-conditioned. All bedrooms also come equipped with satellite-channel TV and DVD player, safe deposit boxes, broadband Internet access and en-suite bathrooms. Most noteworthy, however, is the culturally themed decor unique to each room, which results in each bedroom visually introducing a different unique culture from within the great cultural breadth of Indonesia. Each room has been conceived and interpreted as one of the islands in the Indonesian archipelago: Bali, West Java, East Java, Lombok, Sumatra and Sumba. The colour schemes, furnishings and indigenous arts and crafts in each room reflect its individual theme, the result turning The Longhouse itself into an exotic canvas of riotous colour and intimate style.... and a place of magic.</p><p><b>En-suite Bathrooms</b><br />In keeping with the themed approach, each en-suite bathroom has its own individual characteristics. In one room, you will find both indoor and outdoor showers; another boasts its own plunge pool seemingly placed on the edge of the world. Bathe with a view over the entire island, or in a Sumatran jungle - both are an option so the choice is yours! Blissful rain showers come standard as do private toilets, beautifully crafted washbasins, wonderfully soft towels and gorgeous pampering products.</p><p><b>Living Area &amp; Swimming Pool</b><br />The breezy open air living area needs no other commendation than its panoramic view across two sparkling bays and the gentle bustle of Bali village life below. That said, the plush couches and chairs provided to enjoy those views, which practically seduce you into them, have a lot going for them too!</p><p>You can tap away using the wireless Internet access as you sit under soaring thatched roof cover. Neither walls nor windows mar the perfect picture beyond, leaving it completely open to the silky Bali air. Step off the black Indian slate living area terrace straight into the 60 square metre infinity swimming pool immediately in front. You can either swim laps or relax on the underwater bench, cocktail in hand should the fancy strike, to drink in the relaxing 180-degree vista.</p><p><b>Dining Room</b><br />Just to the left of the living area lies an air-conditioned dining area encased in wraparound windows. Here all doors can be opened if you prefer a more natural climate with fans whirring above. An enormous, unique wooden dining table, with seating for up to 14 people, encourages long, friendly lunches and uproarious evening feasts filled with good food, great wine, fantastic company and rejuvenating laughter. Sit back and let the full complement of staff, including a personal chef, whip up culinary delights and feed your every whim while you create wonderful, lifelong memories.</p><p><b>Kitchen</b><br />An immaculate wooden kitchen, with the very latest in stainless steel appliances, is tucked away next to the dining area, complete with a versatile chef worthy of praise. Should you decide to do your own cooking, you''ll find the views from the kitchen windows rival any to be found in the rest of the house.</p><p><b>Home Theatre/Media Room</b><br />Downstairs from the living area and the tapestry of life playing out in the Balinese villages below, you will find the Home Theatre/Media Room. Justly termed "the best home theatre experience in Bali", watching movies in The Longhouse''s professionally designed media room on the vast TV screen is quite an experience. Add to this deliciously comfortable extensive couches designed for curling up in; 7.1 surround sound enhanced by acoustic wall and floor treatments; and a bowl of popcorn. A great night in for two or 20. iPod docks have been conveniently placed at strategic locations throughout The Longhouse, giving you surround sound access to your favourite music.</p><p><b>Gym &amp; Spa</b><br />Neatly hidden (just in case you don''t want any reminder of the exercise you should be doing on your holiday) on the lower level of The Longhouse, you will find an air-conditioned gym, equipped with state of the art treadmill, Swiss Pilates balls, yoga mats, iPod dock and an outdoor Jacuzzi. Trained instructors can be arranged to come in for your own personal yoga or Pilates session.</p><p>Professional spa therapists are also on call to provide you with any number of luxury spa and healing treatments in the tranquillity of The Longhouse''s private spa treatment room which features two massage beds and a bath for a wonderful Balinese lulur (Balinese body scrub).</p><p><b>Gardens</b><br />Nature weaves its way in everywhere in The Longhouse, thanks to the many indoor gardens. Fish ponds, waterfalls, ponds and trees wait to be discovered and enjoyed. A walk outside into The Longhouse''s landscaped grounds will lead to even more new discoveries and the chance to enjoy nature in beautifully peaceful surroundings.

There are generally no additional costs, surcharges, taxes, staff salaries, or management fees above the price quoted unless otherwise stated in the property description, the Guest booking confirmation or reservation voucher. If the information in any of these is inconsistent, the most recently issued terms will prevail.</p><p>Typically telephone and internet charges and provisioning costs will be the Guestâs responsibility. Gratuities for household staff are encouraged and normal, but are left entirely to the Guestâs discretion.</p><h4><strong>Reservation Voucher</strong></h4><p>Confirmation details, the Property address, contact details of the Owner or Ownerâs Representative, transfer arrangements and directions to the Property will be sent to the Guest in a reservation voucher when full payment is received. This voucher, along with the Guestâs passport, need to be presented upon arrival.</p><p><strong>Security Deposit</strong></p><p>A security deposit may be payable directly to the Owner or Ownerâs Representative immediately upon arrival at the Property. The standard security deposit required for each Property is stated in the Property description; however the Owner has the right to impose different requirements on a case by case basis. Access to the Property may be refused if security deposit is not paid in full. When the security deposit is required to be paid in cash, or when a non-standard security deposit applies, Management will inform the Guest in advance of the amount payable and any other conditions.</p><p>The security deposit will normally be refunded at the end of the rental period, after deducting:</p><ul>	<li>all additional expenses incurred on the Guestâs behalf (e.g. additional charges for goods, services and staff which have not been directly paid by the Guest, and telephone and internet charges, if applicable) and</li>	<li>the cost of replacement or repair for any loss or damage to the Property or its surrounds or contents caused during the Rental Period. If this cost cannot be reasonably determined prior to the Guestâs departure, the Owner or the Ownerâs Representative is entitled to withhold a reasonable estimate from the Guestâs security deposit, and will return any balance to the Guest as soon as possible after the actual cost has been determined.</li></ul><p><strong>Damage or Losses</strong></p><p>A Property is typically someoneâs home. Please treat the Property rented accordingly, and leave the Property and all its contents in good order and in an acceptably clean condition.</p><p>Any damage or losses caused during the Rental Period, as well as any special cleaning requirements will be the Guestâs responsibility and may be charged to the Guestâs account and deducted from the Guestâs security deposit. In cases of excessive or unacceptable loss or damage at any time during the Rental Period, the Owner or Ownerâs Representative may require the Guest and their party, including visitors to vacate the Property immediately, without compensation or refund.</p><h4><strong>Access</strong></h4><p>The Property and its facilities are available for the Guestâs full enjoyment during the Rental Period. However the Owner, Ownerâs Representative, or other staff and contractors may need access to the Property from time to time (e.g. for maintenance purposes to the house, garden, swimming pool, utilities and services, or for the purposes of providing additional services requested by the Guest, etc.). The Guest is required to give them reasonable access to the Property for these purposes.</p><p><strong>Number of Guests</strong></p><p>The number of persons (adults and children) staying at the Property must not exceed the maximum number of sleeping places indicated in the booking confirmation and reservation voucher, unless specifically authorised in writing. Exceeding this number may invalidate any insurance policy on the Property. Entry or access to the Property may be refused or limited where the number of guests exceeds the stated requirement. No pets are allowed unless agreed in writing in advance.</p><p><strong>Use of Property</strong></p><p>All bookings are assumed to be for normal holiday purposes only, and the Guest agrees that the use of the Property will be limited to this purpose unless otherwise confirmed in writing.</p><p>If the Guest is planning to hold an event, such as a wedding or party, which involves having a larger number of people at the Property, or if the Guest is planning to use the Property for a purpose other than holiday, please communicate this to Management&nbsp;at the time of booking, as special approval or arrangements may be required. Depending on the nature of the event, a surcharge and/or additional security deposit may be required, which will be agreed and confirmed in writing prior to confirming the reservation. Note that some Properties are in residential areas or estates, and some are subject to rules and regulations regarding their use. Therefore, it may not always be possible to grant permission for certain uses or activities due to these or other reasons beyond the control of Management&nbsp;and the Owner.</p><p>If Management&nbsp;has confirmed a booking which includes an event at the Guestâs chosen Property, in certain circumstances the Guest must then obtain permits from the police and the local community before the event can proceed. The Guest acknowledges and agrees that Management, the Owner and the Ownerâs Representative cannot control the issue of these permits. If the police and/or the local community refuse to issue a permit for an event at the Property, the Owner or the Ownerâs Representative will refund any event fee paid by the Guest to the Owner, however neither Management, the Owner nor the Ownerâs Representative will be liable for any further refund or payment to the Guest.</p><h4><strong>Conduct and Due Care</strong></h4><p>Properties are generally located in quiet residential neighbourhoods. The Guest is asked to respect this, and ensure that all guests and visitors to the Property behave appropriately. Illegal or immoral activities including gambling, prostitution, prohibited drugs, possession or use of pyrotechnics or dangerous goods, and possession or use of firearms and other weapons are all strictly prohibited. Smoking is generally prohibited unless stated otherwise in the booking confirmation or reservation voucher.</p><p>The Guest is responsible for the behaviour of the guests staying at the Property, as well as visitors to the Property during the Rental Period. Should any guest(s) or visitor(s) not behave in a suitable manner, the Owner or Ownerâs Representative may, in their absolute discretion, require the Guest, their party and/or visitor(s) to leave the premises and/or vacate the Property immediately, without compensation or refund</p><p>In the interests of safety, due care should be taken at the Property at all times, especially with children. Suitable supervision should be given around pools, beaches and roads, and when using all Propertyâs facilities.</p><h4><strong>Valuables and Security</strong></h4><p>Any Guest valuables or property left or used at the Property are at the Guestâs own risk. Neither Management, the Owner nor the Ownerâs Representative accepts any responsibility for loss of or damage to Guest property. The Guest is responsible for the Property during the Rental Period, and must ensure that all windows and doors are locked securely when not on the premises. Any act or omission by the Guest, their party and/or visitors which may negate or prejudice the Propertyâs insurance policy and/or results in loss or damage is the Guestâs responsibility.</p><p><strong>Price Fluctuation</strong></p><p>Once the Guestâs booking is confirmed, the price of the Guestâs reservation is fully guaranteed, even if Management&nbsp;changes the price on its website after the Guestâs booking has been confirmed. In return for this commitment, no refunds will be made for any exchange rate fluctuations that would otherwise reduce the rental cost.</p><p>Management reserves the right to impose any taxes or other charges which may be implemented by any government or other regulatory body, which were unknown at the time of publishing. Management will tell the Guest promptly in the unlikely event that it becomes aware that any taxes or charges will apply to the Guestâs booking.</p><h4><strong>Cancellations</strong></h4><p>If the Guest wishes to cancel a confirmed booking, written notice of cancellation must be sent to Management. All cancellation notices received by Management will be acknowledged in writing. It is strongly recommended that the Guest and all members of the Guestâs party purchase trip cancellation insurance.</p><p>Cancellation of a booking includes but is not limited to:</p><ul>	<li>Cancellation of one or more days of a booking;</li>	<li>An amendment of a booking so that none of the dates of the booking once amended fall within the same dates that originally constituted the booking;</li>	<li>Failure of all Guests to provide the required documentation on arrival (eg. Passports or suitable identification); and</li>	<li>Attempt by the Guest, their party or visitors to hold an event at the Property in breach of these Terms and Conditions or breach of any rules applicable to the Guestâs chosen Property.</li></ul><p>In the event that the Guest cancels a confirmed booking, the following cancellation fees will generally apply:</p><ul>	<li>20% of the total rental amount will be forfeited if the cancellation is made more than 60 days before the start of the rental period</li>	<li>50% of the total rental amount will be forfeited if the cancellation is made between 30 and 60 days before the start of the rental period</li>	<li>100% of the total rental amount will be forfeited if the cancellation is made between 1 and 29 days before the start of the rental period.</li></ul><p>The applicable amount will be deducted from the deposit and moneys paid, and Management will refund any remaining balance to the Guest.</p><h4><strong>Amendments</strong></h4><p>Once a booking confirmation is issued by Management, a fee of USD 50 will apply to each amendment made. Management will do its best to accommodate any reasonable amendments, but the Guest should be aware that some changes may not be possible.</p><p>Please note that these amendment policies apply for regular booking periods. Special amendment terms may apply for peak/high seasons and will be stated in the Property description, booking confirmation or reservation voucher. If the information in any of these is inconsistent, the most recently issued terms will prevail.</p><p>In the unlikely event that Management is unable for any reason (including the sale of a property and force majeure) to provide the Guest with the Property booked by the Guest, Management reserves the right to transfer the Guest and their party to an alternative Property of the similar type and value, in consultation with the Guest. If the price of the substituted Property is less than the original booking, the difference will be reimbursed to the Guest. If the price of the substituted Property is higher than the original booking, the difference may be charged to the Guest. If, however, after considerable effort by Management, no alternative of similar type and value is available and / or no agreement can be reached between the Guest and Management, then either Management or the Guest may opt to cancel the booking and this Rental Contract. In that event, Management will refund the Guest all monies paid, without further compensation.</p><h4><strong>Complaints</strong></h4><p>Every attempt will be made for the Guest to have an enjoyable stay. If the Guest should have a problem during the Rental Period, please inform the Owner or Ownerâs Representative immediately who will endeavour to put things right.

The standard security deposit required for each Property is stated in the Property description; however the Owner has the right to impose different requirements on a case by case basis. Access to the Property may be refused if security deposit is not paid in full. When the security deposit is required to be paid in cash, or when a non-standard security deposit applies, Management will inform the Guest in advance of the amount payable and any other conditions.</p><p>The security deposit will normally be refunded at the end of the rental period, after deducting:</p><ul>	<li>all additional expenses incurred on the Guestâs behalf (e.g. additional charges for goods, services and staff which have not been directly paid by the Guest, and telephone and internet charges, if applicable) and</li>	<li>the cost of replacement or repair for any loss or damage to the Property or its surrounds or contents caused during the Rental Period. If this cost cannot be reasonably determined prior to the Guestâs departure, the Owner or the Ownerâs Representative is entitled to withhold a reasonable estimate from the Guestâs security deposit, and will return any balance to the Guest as soon as possible after the actual cost has been determined.</li></ul><p><strong>Damage or Losses</strong></p><p>A Property is typically someoneâs home. Please treat the Property rented accordingly, and leave the Property and all its contents in good order and in an acceptably clean condition.</p><p>Any damage or losses caused during the Rental Period, as well as any special cleaning requirements will be the Guestâs responsibility and may be charged to the Guestâs account and deducted from the Guestâs security deposit. In cases of excessive or unacceptable loss or damage at any time during the Rental Period, the Owner or Ownerâs Representative may require the Guest and their party, including visitors to vacate the Property immediately, without compensation or refund.</p><h4><strong>Access</strong></h4><p>The Property and its facilities are available for the Guestâs full enjoyment during the Rental Period. However the Owner, Ownerâs Representative, or other staff and contractors may need access to the Property from time to time (e.g. for maintenance purposes to the house, garden, swimming pool, utilities and services, or for the purposes of providing additional services requested by the Guest, etc.). The Guest is required to give them reasonable access to the Property for these purposes.</p><p><strong>Number of Guests</strong></p><p>The number of persons (adults and children) staying at the Property must not exceed the maximum number of sleeping places indicated in the booking confirmation and reservation voucher, unless specifically authorised in writing. Exceeding this number may invalidate any insurance policy on the Property. Entry or access to the Property may be refused or limited where the number of guests exceeds the stated requirement. No pets are allowed unless agreed in writing in advance.</p><p><strong>Use of Property</strong></p><p>All bookings are assumed to be for normal holiday purposes only, and the Guest agrees that the use of the Property will be limited to this purpose unless otherwise confirmed in writing.</p><p>If the Guest is planning to hold an event, such as a wedding or party, which involves having a larger number of people at the Property, or if the Guest is planning to use the Property for a purpose other than holiday, please communicate this to Management&nbsp;at the time of booking, as special approval or arrangements may be required. Depending on the nature of the event, a surcharge and/or additional security deposit may be required, which will be agreed and confirmed in writing prior to confirming the reservation. Note that some Properties are in residential areas or estates, and some are subject to rules and regulations regarding their use. Therefore, it may not always be possible to grant permission for certain uses or activities due to these or other reasons beyond the control of Management&nbsp;and the Owner.</p><p>If Management&nbsp;has confirmed a booking which includes an event at the Guestâs chosen Property, in certain circumstances the Guest must then obtain permits from the police and the local community before the event can proceed. The Guest acknowledges and agrees that Management, the Owner and the Ownerâs Representative cannot control the issue of these permits. If the police and/or the local community refuse to issue a permit for an event at the Property, the Owner or the Ownerâs Representative will refund any event fee paid by the Guest to the Owner, however neither Management, the Owner nor the Ownerâs Representative will be liable for any further refund or payment to the Guest.</p><h4><strong>Conduct and Due Care</strong></h4><p>Properties are generally located in quiet residential neighbourhoods.

Smoking is generally prohibited unless stated otherwise in the booking confirmation or reservation voucher.</p><p>The Guest is responsible for the behaviour of the guests staying at the Property, as well as visitors to the Property during the Rental Period. Should any guest(s) or visitor(s) not behave in a suitable manner, the Owner or Ownerâs Representative may, in their absolute discretion, require the Guest, their party and/or visitor(s) to leave the premises and/or vacate the Property immediately, without compensation or refund</p><p>In the interests of safety, due care should be taken at the Property at all times, especially with children. Suitable supervision should be given around pools, beaches and roads, and when using all Propertyâs facilities.</p><h4><strong>Valuables and Security</strong></h4><p>Any Guest valuables or property left or used at the Property are at the Guestâs own risk. Neither Management, the Owner nor the Ownerâs Representative accepts any responsibility for loss of or damage to Guest property. The Guest is responsible for the Property during the Rental Period, and must ensure that all windows and doors are locked securely when not on the premises. Any act or omission by the Guest, their party and/or visitors which may negate or prejudice the Propertyâs insurance policy and/or results in loss or damage is the Guestâs responsibility.</p><p><strong>Price Fluctuation</strong></p><p>Once the Guestâs booking is confirmed, the price of the Guestâs reservation is fully guaranteed, even if Management&nbsp;changes the price on its website after the Guestâs booking has been confirmed. In return for this commitment, no refunds will be made for any exchange rate fluctuations that would otherwise reduce the rental cost.</p><p>Management reserves the right to impose any taxes or other charges which may be implemented by any government or other regulatory body, which were unknown at the time of publishing. Management will tell the Guest promptly in the unlikely event that it becomes aware that any taxes or charges will apply to the Guestâs booking.</p><h4><strong>Cancellations</strong></h4><p>If the Guest wishes to cancel a confirmed booking, written notice of cancellation must be sent to Management.

Passports or suitable identification); and</li>	<li>Attempt by the Guest, their party or visitors to hold an event at the Property in breach of these Terms and Conditions or breach of any rules applicable to the Guestâs chosen Property.</li></ul><p>In the event that the Guest cancels a confirmed booking, the following cancellation fees will generally apply:</p><ul>	<li>20% of the total rental amount will be forfeited if the cancellation is made more than 60 days before the start of the rental period</li>	<li>50% of the total rental amount will be forfeited if the cancellation is made between 30 and 60 days before the start of the rental period</li>	<li>100% of the total rental amount will be forfeited if the cancellation is made between 1 and 29 days before the start of the rental period.</li></ul><p>The applicable amount will be deducted from the deposit and moneys paid, and Management will refund any remaining balance to the Guest.</p><h4><strong>Amendments</strong></h4><p>Once a booking confirmation is issued by Management, a fee of USD 50 will apply to each amendment made. Management will do its best to accommodate any reasonable amendments, but the Guest should be aware that some changes may not be possible.</p><p>Please note that these amendment policies apply for regular booking periods. Special amendment terms may apply for peak/high seasons and will be stated in the Property description, booking confirmation or reservation voucher. If the information in any of these is inconsistent, the most recently issued terms will prevail.</p><p>In the unlikely event that Management is unable for any reason (including the sale of a property and force majeure) to provide the Guest with the Property booked by the Guest, Management reserves the right to transfer the Guest and their party to an alternative Property of the similar type and value, in consultation with the Guest. If the price of the substituted Property is less than the original booking, the difference will be reimbursed to the Guest. If the price of the substituted Property is higher than the original booking, the difference may be charged to the Guest. If, however, after considerable effort by Management, no alternative of similar type and value is available and / or no agreement can be reached between the Guest and Management, then either Management or the Guest may opt to cancel the booking and this Rental Contract. In that event, Management will refund the Guest all monies paid, without further compensation.</p><h4><strong>Complaints</strong></h4><p>Every attempt will be made for the Guest to have an enjoyable stay. If the Guest should have a problem during the Rental Period, please inform the Owner or Ownerâs Representative immediately who will endeavour to put things right. Should the Owner or Ownerâs Representative not address the Guestâs problem satisfactorily, please contact Management promptly. In order for the Guestâs complaint to be addressed, the Guest must communicate any problem whilst on location. If no complaint is reported during the Rental Period, Management and the Owner will assume that the Property was to the Guestâs satisfaction and no complaint will be entertained.</p><p><strong>Provisions</strong></p><p>Self-catering accommodations require that the Guest supply all provisions and consumables necessary for daily living. The staff at the Property may accommodate any reasonable requests to purchase provisions on the Guestâs behalf, and this will be charged to the Guestâs account.</p><p><strong>Managementâs Responsibility</strong></p><p>The descriptions, assessments and/or ratings of Properties and surrounding locations that Management publishes or gives to the Guest are provided in good faith and in the belief that they are accurate based on the latest information received. However, Management cannot be held responsible for any modifications to the Properties or inaccuracies. Where Management publishes or refers to descriptions, assessments and/or ratings of the Property either by Management or by third parties, these ratings are for information purposes only and Management will not be held responsible for any reliance placed on these ratings.</p><p><strong>Disclaimers</strong></p><p>Neither Management, the Owner nor the Ownerâs Representative accepts any responsibility or liability for:</p><ul>	<li>any physical injury, sickness, death, loss, damage, inconvenience or additional expenses incurred by the Guest, their party or visitors regardless of the cause;</li>	<li>any vehicle or the contents of any vehicle used, hired or engaged by the Guest or their party during the Rental Period;<br />	inability of the Guest or any member of the Guestâs party to enter the location of the Property or stay at the Property for all or part of the Rental Period as a result of failure to obtain appropriate travel or visa documentation, cancellation or amendments to travel arrangements or the missing of flights or travel connections; and/or</li>	<li>any delay or cancellation of the booking as a result of war, threat of war, riot or civil strife, strike, demonstration, terrorist activity (threatened or actual), natural disaster, fire, sickness, weather conditions, action at an airport or port by any government or public authority, technical problems relating to transport and airport regulations caused by technical, mechanical or electrical breakdowns, or any technical, structural, electrical, plumbing or other problems or difficulties with the Property which make it unsafe or unusable, or any other circumstances which amount to âforce majeureâ or Acts of God, or other events beyond the Ownerâs control.</li></ul><p>In no case will Management, the Owner or the Ownerâs Representative individually or collectively be liable to make any payment or give any refund or compensation of any amount over and above the total rental amount paid.</p><h4><strong>Jurisdiction&nbsp;</strong></h4><p>This agreement will be governed by the laws of Hong Kong. In the event of controversy arising from the booking and Property rental that cannot be resolved amicably between the parties, both parties agree to exclusively refer the matter to the Singapore International Arbitration Centre to be resolved finally by arbitration in the English language.</p><p>By making its booking request, the Guest agrees that these terms and conditions have been read, understood and have been accepted and agreed to by the Guest without reservation and without exception.</p><p>If any of the conditions of this Rental Contract are or become or are deemed to be invalid, or if there is any omission from any terms and conditions, the remaining terms and conditions will remain valid and enforceable and cannot be contested.</p><p><strong>Seasons</strong></p><ul>	<li>Low Season&nbsp;(Min.

The following deposit payment must be received by Management:</p><ul>	<li>For rentals beginning more than 60 days after the date of the booking request â a deposit of 50% of the total rental amount is payable</li>	<li>For rentals beginning 60 days or less after the date of the booking request â the total rental amount is payable as a deposit</li></ul><p>If the required deposit payment is not received within the 5 working day period, Management&nbsp;reserves the right to void the Guestâs booking request.</p><p>Where a 50% deposit applies to the booking, the Guest must pay the remaining 50% balance not less than 60 days before the scheduled arrival date.</p><p>All payments must be made in US Dollars, unless otherwise agreed with Management, and must be made in accordance with managementâs payment instructions as set out in the Guestâs booking confirmation.</p><p>If payments are not made on or before the due dates as required herein, the Owner or the Ownerâs Representative may cancel the booking, in which case this Rental Contract will be thereby terminated without any further notice required. Cancellation charges may apply as detailed below.</p><h4><strong>Additional costs</strong></h4><p>The cost of electricity, mains water, cleaning and garden supplies, and local taxes are included in rental rates. There are generally no additional costs, surcharges, taxes, staff salaries, or management fees above the price quoted unless otherwise stated in the property description, the Guest booking confirmation or reservation voucher. If the information in any of these is inconsistent, the most recently issued terms will prevail.</p><p>Typically telephone and internet charges and provisioning costs will be the Guestâs responsibility. Gratuities for household staff are encouraged and normal, but are left entirely to the Guestâs discretion.</p><h4><strong>Reservation Voucher</strong></h4><p>Confirmation details, the Property address, contact details of the Owner or Ownerâs Representative, transfer arrangements and directions to the Property will be sent to the Guest in a reservation voucher when full payment is received. This voucher, along with the Guestâs passport, need to be presented upon arrival.</p><p><strong>Security Deposit</strong></p><p>A security deposit may be payable directly to the Owner or Ownerâs Representative immediately upon arrival at the Property. The standard security deposit required for each Property is stated in the Property description; however the Owner has the right to impose different requirements on a case by case basis. Access to the Property may be refused if security deposit is not paid in full. When the security deposit is required to be paid in cash, or when a non-standard security deposit applies, Management will inform the Guest in advance of the amount payable and any other conditions.</p><p>The security deposit will normally be refunded at the end of the rental period, after deducting:</p><ul>	<li>all additional expenses incurred on the Guestâs behalf (e.g. additional charges for goods, services and staff which have not been directly paid by the Guest, and telephone and internet charges, if applicable) and</li>	<li>the cost of replacement or repair for any loss or damage to the Property or its surrounds or contents caused during the Rental Period. If this cost cannot be reasonably determined prior to the Guestâs departure, the Owner or the Ownerâs Representative is entitled to withhold a reasonable estimate from the Guestâs security deposit, and will return any balance to the Guest as soon as possible after the actual cost has been determined.</li></ul><p><strong>Damage or Losses</strong></p><p>A Property is typically someoneâs home. Please treat the Property rented accordingly, and leave the Property and all its contents in good order and in an acceptably clean condition.</p><p>Any damage or losses caused during the Rental Period, as well as any special cleaning requirements will be the Guestâs responsibility and may be charged to the Guestâs account and deducted from the Guestâs security deposit. In cases of excessive or unacceptable loss or damage at any time during the Rental Period, the Owner or Ownerâs Representative may require the Guest and their party, including visitors to vacate the Property immediately, without compensation or refund.</p><h4><strong>Access</strong></h4><p>The Property and its facilities are available for the Guestâs full enjoyment during the Rental Period. However the Owner, Ownerâs Representative, or other staff and contractors may need access to the Property from time to time (e.g. for maintenance purposes to the house, garden, swimming pool, utilities and services, or for the purposes of providing additional services requested by the Guest, etc.). The Guest is required to give them reasonable access to the Property for these purposes.</p><p><strong>Number of Guests</strong></p><p>The number of persons (adults and children) staying at the Property must not exceed the maximum number of sleeping places indicated in the booking confirmation and reservation voucher, unless specifically authorised in writing. Exceeding this number may invalidate any insurance policy on the Property. Entry or access to the Property may be refused or limited where the number of guests exceeds the stated requirement. No pets are allowed unless agreed in writing in advance.</p><p><strong>Use of Property</strong></p><p>All bookings are assumed to be for normal holiday purposes only, and the Guest agrees that the use of the Property will be limited to this purpose unless otherwise confirmed in writing.</p><p>If the Guest is planning to hold an event, such as a wedding or party, which involves having a larger number of people at the Property, or if the Guest is planning to use the Property for a purpose other than holiday, please communicate this to Management&nbsp;at the time of booking, as special approval or arrangements may be required. Depending on the nature of the event, a surcharge and/or additional security deposit may be required, which will be agreed and confirmed in writing prior to confirming the reservation. Note that some Properties are in residential areas or estates, and some are subject to rules and regulations regarding their use. Therefore, it may not always be possible to grant permission for certain uses or activities due to these or other reasons beyond the control of Management&nbsp;and the Owner.</p><p>If Management&nbsp;has confirmed a booking which includes an event at the Guestâs chosen Property, in certain circumstances the Guest must then obtain permits from the police and the local community before the event can proceed. The Guest acknowledges and agrees that Management, the Owner and the Ownerâs Representative cannot control the issue of these permits. If the police and/or the local community refuse to issue a permit for an event at the Property, the Owner or the Ownerâs Representative will refund any event fee paid by the Guest to the Owner, however neither Management, the Owner nor the Ownerâs Representative will be liable for any further refund or payment to the Guest.</p><h4><strong>Conduct and Due Care</strong></h4><p>Properties are generally located in quiet residential neighbourhoods. The Guest is asked to respect this, and ensure that all guests and visitors to the Property behave appropriately. Illegal or immoral activities including gambling, prostitution, prohibited drugs, possession or use of pyrotechnics or dangerous goods, and possession or use of firearms and other weapons are all strictly prohibited. Smoking is generally prohibited unless stated otherwise in the booking confirmation or reservation voucher.</p><p>The Guest is responsible for the behaviour of the guests staying at the Property, as well as visitors to the Property during the Rental Period. Should any guest(s) or visitor(s) not behave in a suitable manner, the Owner or Ownerâs Representative may, in their absolute discretion, require the Guest, their party and/or visitor(s) to leave the premises and/or vacate the Property immediately, without compensation or refund</p><p>In the interests of safety, due care should be taken at the Property at all times, especially with children. Suitable supervision should be given around pools, beaches and roads, and when using all Propertyâs facilities.</p><h4><strong>Valuables and Security</strong></h4><p>Any Guest valuables or property left or used at the Property are at the Guestâs own risk. Neither Management, the Owner nor the Ownerâs Representative accepts any responsibility for loss of or damage to Guest property. The Guest is responsible for the Property during the Rental Period, and must ensure that all windows and doors are locked securely when not on the premises. Any act or omission by the Guest, their party and/or visitors which may negate or prejudice the Propertyâs insurance policy and/or results in loss or damage is the Guestâs responsibility.</p><p><strong>Price Fluctuation</strong></p><p>Once the Guestâs booking is confirmed, the price of the Guestâs reservation is fully guaranteed, even if Management&nbsp;changes the price on its website after the Guestâs booking has been confirmed. In return for this commitment, no refunds will be made for any exchange rate fluctuations that would otherwise reduce the rental cost.</p><p>Management reserves the right to impose any taxes or other charges which may be implemented by any government or other regulatory body, which were unknown at the time of publishing. Management will tell the Guest promptly in the unlikely event that it becomes aware that any taxes or charges will apply to the Guestâs booking.</p><h4><strong>Cancellations</strong></h4><p>If the Guest wishes to cancel a confirmed booking, written notice of cancellation must be sent to Management. All cancellation notices received by Management will be acknowledged in writing. It is strongly recommended that the Guest and all members of the Guestâs party purchase trip cancellation insurance.</p><p>Cancellation of a booking includes but is not limited to:</p><ul>	<li>Cancellation of one or more days of a booking;</li>	<li>An amendment of a booking so that none of the dates of the booking once amended fall within the same dates that originally constituted the booking;</li>	<li>Failure of all Guests to provide the required documentation on arrival (eg. Passports or suitable identification); and</li>	<li>Attempt by the Guest, their party or visitors to hold an event at the Property in breach of these Terms and Conditions or breach of any rules applicable to the Guestâs chosen Property.</li></ul><p>In the event that the Guest cancels a confirmed booking, the following cancellation fees will generally apply:</p><ul>	<li>20% of the total rental amount will be forfeited if the cancellation is made more than 60 days before the start of the rental period</li>	<li>50% of the total rental amount will be forfeited if the cancellation is made between 30 and 60 days before the start of the rental period</li>	<li>100% of the total rental amount will be forfeited if the cancellation is made between 1 and 29 days before the start of the rental period.</li></ul><p>The applicable amount will be deducted from the deposit and moneys paid, and Management will refund any remaining balance to the Guest.</p><h4><strong>Amendments</strong></h4><p>Once a booking confirmation is issued by Management, a fee of USD 50 will apply to each amendment made. Management will do its best to accommodate any reasonable amendments, but the Guest should be aware that some changes may not be possible.</p><p>Please note that these amendment policies apply for regular booking periods. Special amendment terms may apply for peak/high seasons and will be stated in the Property description, booking confirmation or reservation voucher. If the information in any of these is inconsistent, the most recently issued terms will prevail.</p><p>In the unlikely event that Management is unable for any reason (including the sale of a property and force majeure) to provide the Guest with the Property booked by the Guest, Management reserves the right to transfer the Guest and their party to an alternative Property of the similar type and value, in consultation with the Guest. If the price of the substituted Property is less than the original booking, the difference will be reimbursed to the Guest. If the price of the substituted Property is higher than the original booking, the difference may be charged to the Guest. If, however, after considerable effort by Management, no alternative of similar type and value is available and / or no agreement can be reached between the Guest and Management, then either Management or the Guest may opt to cancel the booking and this Rental Contract. In that event, Management will refund the Guest all monies paid, without further compensation.</p><h4><strong>Complaints</strong></h4><p>Every attempt will be made for the Guest to have an enjoyable stay. If the Guest should have a problem during the Rental Period, please inform the Owner or Ownerâs Representative immediately who will endeavour to put things right. Should the Owner or Ownerâs Representative not address the Guestâs problem satisfactorily, please contact Management promptly. In order for the Guestâs complaint to be addressed, the Guest must communicate any problem whilst on location. If no complaint is reported during the Rental Period, Management and the Owner will assume that the Property was to the Guestâs satisfaction and no complaint will be entertained.</p><p><strong>Provisions</strong></p><p>Self-catering accommodations require that the Guest supply all provisions and consumables necessary for daily living. The staff at the Property may accommodate any reasonable requests to purchase provisions on the Guestâs behalf, and this will be charged to the Guestâs account.</p><p><strong>Managementâs Responsibility</strong></p><p>The descriptions, assessments and/or ratings of Properties and surrounding locations that Management publishes or gives to the Guest are provided in good faith and in the belief that they are accurate based on the latest information received. However, Management cannot be held responsible for any modifications to the Properties or inaccuracies. Where Management publishes or refers to descriptions, assessments and/or ratings of the Property either by Management or by third parties, these ratings are for information purposes only and Management will not be held responsible for any reliance placed on these ratings.</p><p><strong>Disclaimers</strong></p><p>Neither Management, the Owner nor the Ownerâs Representative accepts any responsibility or liability for:</p><ul>	<li>any physical injury, sickness, death, loss, damage, inconvenience or additional expenses incurred by the Guest, their party or visitors regardless of the cause;</li>	<li>any vehicle or the contents of any vehicle used, hired or engaged by the Guest or their party during the Rental Period;<br />	inability of the Guest or any member of the Guestâs party to enter the location of the Property or stay at the Property for all or part of the Rental Period as a result of failure to obtain appropriate travel or visa documentation, cancellation or amendments to travel arrangements or the missing of flights or travel connections; and/or</li>	<li>any delay or cancellation of the booking as a result of war, threat of war, riot or civil strife, strike, demonstration, terrorist activity (threatened or actual), natural disaster, fire, sickness, weather conditions, action at an airport or port by any government or public authority, technical problems relating to transport and airport regulations caused by technical, mechanical or electrical breakdowns, or any technical, structural, electrical, plumbing or other problems or difficulties with the Property which make it unsafe or unusable, or any other circumstances which amount to âforce majeureâ or Acts of God, or other events beyond the Ownerâs control.</li></ul><p>In no case will Management, the Owner or the Ownerâs Representative individually or collectively be liable to make any payment or give any refund or compensation of any amount over and above the total rental amount paid.</p><h4><strong>Jurisdiction&nbsp;</strong></h4><p>This agreement will be governed by the laws of Hong Kong. In the event of controversy arising from the booking and Property rental that cannot be resolved amicably between the parties, both parties agree to exclusively refer the matter to the Singapore International Arbitration Centre to be resolved finally by arbitration in the English language.</p><p>By making its booking request, the Guest agrees that these terms and conditions have been read, understood and have been accepted and agreed to by the Guest without reservation and without exception.</p><p>If any of the conditions of this Rental Contract are or become or are deemed to be invalid, or if there is any omission from any terms and conditions, the remaining terms and conditions will remain valid and enforceable and cannot be contested.</p><p><strong>Seasons</strong></p><ul>	<li>Low Season&nbsp;(Min.
